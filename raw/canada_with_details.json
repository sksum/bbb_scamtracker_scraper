    "Description": "I was recently offered a position at a company called outsourced ATLAS PAYMENTS SOLUTIONS LTD. This is the website: https://atlaspays.com/\nAs far as I knew at first the job was completely online and didn't really have any concerns. We exchanged a variety of emails (via c.berger@atlaspays.com) regarding contracts and personal information. I can provide details with specifics of the documents if necessary. I gave them information that is usually expected to be offered up when getting a new job. (aka address, full name, driver's license images, etc.)\nAfter a couple of days, she (who aliases herself as Christine Berger) replies congratulating me on my acceptance of the position of Customer Service Manager and that by signing the following document and sending my payment information I would be a confirmed employee (calling me from 44 20 8638 6979). So I open up the form to input my direct deposit information, and I find something a bit skeptical.\nThey had asked me for *Bank Daily Withdrawal Limit* and *ATM Daily Withdrawal Limit*, as well as the name of my bitcoin exchanger, trade platform, etc on the form. This made me very skeptical, as I had received employment scams before, and this seemed similar.\nI did some research on the website and found that there \"SETIGO Security\" tag:\n(https://secure.sectigo.com/ttb_searcher/trustlogo?v_querytype=W&amp;v_shortname=CL1&amp;v_search=https://atlaspays.com/&amp;x=6&amp;y=5)\nwas most likely fake and most likely bought from this site:\nhttps://www.ssls.com/brand/sectigo-ssl-certificates?gclid=Cj0KCQjwjPaCBhDkARIsAISZN7RtkEl2d_jeqcm59gzkfDJdfDAZsrYT4YNu1cRyO7sR2TSfq-BFPc8aAvNREALw_wcB\nAlso, any address listed on the website did not correspond to any specific location/office (might possibly be because they are a startup, not sure I've been to legitimate offices for Telus which looked very sketchy), but rather a virtual office space.\nThe scammer has ceased contact with me when asked about details regarding ATM/Bank daily withdrawal limit reasons. I learned that the scammer was most likely trying to get me to receive fake cheques and stolen cc payments, and sending them to the scammer via crypto or cash from an ATM.",

    "Description": "I have been using the website Indeed to look for a new job. I was emailed by an individual that called himself \"Edward Powell\", the Human Resource Manager of BergaMine/Bergamo Inc. He said he found my resume on Indeed and wanted to offer me a position as a remote, part time Administrative Assistant with a too-good-to-be-true employment package. He requested I email him not through the Indeed platform, but his business email: edward.powell@bergaminebiz.com.\nWhen I replied to \"Edward Powell\", inquiring about some reservations I had about the information he had provided, he ignored my questions (after having solicited them) and sent me an application form for a job in New Zealand even though they are an American company and I am in Canada with the quoted salary being in Canadian dollars, though improperly formatted. When I replied with more questions and an open accusation of the job being a scam, he didn't reply back.\nI informed Indeed of \"Edward Powell\" being a scam, but as I was going to email the company as well to inform them of the situation thinking their name was being used without their knowledge, I realized that \"Edward Powell\" was using a bergaminebiz email address. BergaMine describes itself as a Cryptocurrency mining business, but I have no real information about the business itself; in fact I can't find anything about the business outside of it's polished website and a few casual forum post advertisements. I realized that the whole business was likely a scam and so came here hoping I'd see the company listed. It is not, hence me informing you of this situation. I have the email conversation and the application that was sent to me should you require them.",

They told me about the job and sent me a link to contact the interviewer Eduardo Guarnieri to set up an interview. Even went as far as to wish me good luck &amp; ask me to let them know how it goes. I had to download the Telegram app to use for the interview which was done via text messaging. When I asked him about doing a Zoom interview he said that video conferencing is used for training (this was for a supposed work from home job). I was suspicious from the beginning so as he was interviewing me I was looking for the company on line. The company is legitimate although the recruiter &amp; interviewer are the scammers. My suspicions were confirmed when I emailed the actual company through their legitimate website. They contacted me telling me that no one by those names worked for them, and that job openings are only posted through their website. Another indication of this being a scam is that the interviewer would not provide me with a contact # for human resources when I asked, and told me that would only be provided upon orientation. Also, the rate of pay seemed to good to be true, and they offered me a job 10 mins after completion of the interview. I told them I was going to not accept the offer. I did not provide any SIN # or bank account number but they did have my full name &amp; the name of the bank I deal with. They would have got my address from my resume, because my phone # &amp; address are on my resume.",

I showed my interest because I was an active job seeker to which she sent me a link to a job application site (https://cutt.ly/8k8Gan3). It asked me for my SIN there and stupidly enough, I filled it out. She was were extremely professional and the only thing that was not sitting right with me was the huge salary. After that, I was asked to fill a Questionnaire asking all the right questions! She sent to me the job offer and employment agreement, next day, which I signed.\nI checked on Google if they really existed and a website - with the URL www.outsourced.group - claimed to follow exactly what they had been doing so far; Invitational job offers by HR team &lt; FOUR positions for which they were hiring &lt; Questionnaire &amp; Employment Agreement sent out &lt; Final Voice Interview. So, I entrusted them.\nAnd then she asked me to add her to my contacts on Telegram (@nicoleleman). I texted to her confirming my decision and I set up a 'Voice-Interview' with another person 'Matthew Attwood'. My phone detected that the call was from Jersey City, NJ, United States. I had already been calling the CRA, police and Service Canada after my chat with the them to secure my accounts and identity as I was vary of the grammatical errors in their messages now, on Telegram.\nIn the interview, he only asked me the answers to two of the questions I had already filled out in the Questionnaire and said that I might expect a positive reply. The next morning I received a job offer from their end asking from me to fill a TD1 form. I was hesitant and texted her that I don't think I would be continuing the offer to which she removed me from their contacts - deleting the messages for me and her!!\nThey were EXTREMELY professional and good with the documents (Job offer, questionnaire and letter of acceptance) that I would not have known at all if I hadn't been a little suspicious and if my curiosity didn't drive me to see what job scams look like:\n1. They asked for my SIN in the job application before I even had the job.\n2. The email was sent out via sendgrid.net (known for mass scams).\n3. Neither Nicole Leman (HR Operations Manager) nor Matthew Attwood (Regional Director, North America Division, United States Department) appeared to exist on LinkedIn.\n4. Those are not even real positions.\n5. Switching to fast-texting app (Telegram).\n6. Grammatical errors when on Telegram (almost as if they copy-pasted the acceptable email content to each victim unless they typed the whole message out on their own)\n7. The mail that I had received started with a 'Dear Candidate' and not my name.\nBe very careful guys and do look at the attachments to see how professional they sounded.",

I didn&rsquo;t catch this at first and told them I was interested. It was the second email offering me a probationary position that really raised the flags. First, the wording was changed. Administrative Assistant became Financial Administrative Assistant.

    "Description": "This could also be considered a CryptoCurrency scam* I received an email regarding a job offer from Cynthia P., she supposedly found my name and email through Indeed. At first there were a couple small sketchy things but with COVID and being hired for work from home its sometimes hard to tell. I was set to start Monday and all was fine and then Tuesday came and Cynthia wanted me to go look for my closest Bitcoin ATM and  figure out how to use it as part of my training. I was thrown off because I know absolutely nothing about Bitcoin so I was hesitant and I've heard a lot about these types of scams and everything started to add up. My last email from Cynthia P. was asking me to give my banking information so a client can send me money from me to send in Bitcoin to Cynthia, this OBVIOUSLY is a scam and I know to never do anything like that. So I proceeded to do a bunch of research and called the company directly to find out who this person was and sure enough she doesn't work for them and is operating a scam. I'm glad I was smart enough to recognize the red flags from the beginning and never give her too much information. Hopefully this information can help someone else in the future.",

She wanted to recruit me as a Personal Assistant, all the documents she sent and their website (https://yellowstarinc.com/) seemed pretty legit for a startup and an important red flag - I never applied for the job instead they reached out to me. I initially ignored the red flags because we are just starting to adapt the cryptocurrency world, I had similar work experience and having Canada very recently opening up to bitcoin ETF's I thought maybe this firm/start up just wants to jump on that ship real quick which I do too. Their Job Description, Application Form and employment contract seems just like one from a legit, well established company but too good to be true for a start up who has no information on the internet. Basically they wanted me to send my direct deposit information and somehow scam me out of my money because when I looked up their California (Ph. +1 308 300 7978;\n2545 W. 237th Street Torrance, CA 90505 USA) address on Google street view I found myself at a business park's parking lot and the first thing that made me click was Charlie saying they were in the process of opening up an office in Winnipeg but on their website they conveniently missed out on a suite number for the Winnipeg address (Ph. +1 204 272 0383;\n201 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3C 0B9 Canada). Then on their website the Privacy and Policy button can't be clicked which always means something is wrong! I am glad I took my time to research.",

So I reached out to the Facebook poster and was given a gmail address to submit my resume to.\nOn Google Hangouts I was contacted by the email address adeccogroup1902@gmail.com and was asked to answer a series of simple questions. The job offered $22/hour, 25 hours per week, remote. I was given the job after 30 minutes of questions and waiting for \"executives\" to discuss my application. I was overjoyed. But when they discussed sending me a cheque to buy equipment to get started, the situation began looking suspicious.\nI gave them a profile photo of myself, and my contact information--phone, address, even my deposit info for my bank account--but when they asked me for my online banking login information, insisting that their system for sending cheques was in maintenance, it was the final straw. I asked for Interac e-transfer instead, but they said that was down too. When I refused to give my banking login, they stopped messaging back. The person on Google Hangouts also immediately changed from \"adecco1902\" to \"Gary Sousis.\"\nAs a newcomer to Canada, I have faced rental scams, and now an employment scam, and I am very discouraged about my future here.

    "Description": "Applied for a job on Indeed as a Data Entry Operator/Computer Operator for a company called 'S Choi Professional Corp.'\nThey then messaged me a few days later to say they had another position available as a remote Multitask Manager that they wanted me to reach out to them by email about. It said they have full-time &amp; part-time positions available &amp; they pay $1200/$600 per week depending on that.\nI emailed them asking more information about the company and position and they sent me the details including a list of questions for me to answer. I answered all the questions and received an offer to start a 10 day probationary period with them. They sent me a link with a contract to sign to start the position without even calling me or setting up a virtual interview.\nI did a lot of research about their company and although they have a website and apparently they registered their company with the government (link on website) since year 2000, they don't seem to have any other online presence. They told me I will be reporting to them (The HR Manager who emailed me) which doesn't really make any sense to me. I haven't signed the contract or responded since they sent it to me as I felt there are too many red flags. I haven't confirmed this is a scam but it seems way too fishy based on the salary, title and everything else.",

Now I can only assume that this 'Light Media Allies' is a complete scam designed to get people to transfer their money into Bitcoin accounts so they can steal it. When I was accepted as an employee I participated in a pre-training session and I was asked several questions relating to normal customer service activities. The second day of training was when I noticed the problem. I was asked to watch a video explaining Bitcoin, which did not seem to far-fetched right away, but after providing a summary on the video I was asked to create an account where I could deposit Bitcoin. I was also asked to locate the nearest ATM where I could deposit Bitcoin. In what customer service situation would this ever be relevant? At this point I decided to cut all ties with anyone and begin the reporting process. In some odd situation where this somehow is not a scam, I can still say that this so-called company needs to be investigated for ethics and practice violations.",

This company told me they would pay me 1480cad biweekly for office administration duties for their company. I searched their company and showed as a betting company the website didn&rsquo;t really give a lot of detail but because this was on indeed, I inquired more. I got a call from a lady name Eva who interviewed me said everything will be online due to COVID-19. So I understood, this lady asked me about using my personal account for training I told her I would never do such a thing she told me that was ok it will be office work anyway. So I got the job offer quit my previous job started with this company Jan 12 2021. The 1st day Eva asked me to send information about flights to Toronto to Calgary and provide the best flight offers, so I did. The second day Eva asked me to go to a bitcoin machine and take a picture and send it to her said to know how to use the machine, so I did. Then she asked me to use my personal account again so they could send me a transfer I told Eva we talked about this the 1st day why are you asking me to use my personal account again, she became frantic and said would call me back. I haven&rsquo;t heard back from her or about the days work I did and as well the inconvenience of being lured from my previous job. So I googled company bitcoin scam and that&rsquo;s when I saw this issue being ramped during COVID-19 , its something that is happening frequently, so overall I just want the public to know and catch these people who are doing it.",

This is the email address from which I was told that for the probationary period of 30 days (20 working days) I  would need to provide them with either my banking or credit card information so they can deposit \"payments \" to my account and then I was to withdraw said amount and take it to an approved ATM, from a list of ATMs they would provide me with. It was emphasized that my account would only be used for the probationary period and this was to see how fast I could process payments.

It was close to Christmas and any extra money coming in would be great so I replied to the attached email.\nThe company then gave me information about the position\nGot me to e sign some documents (a temporary 10 day trial period)\nThen sent me an email about what they do and how they use cryptocurrency.\nThat was when a flag went up I never heard of that before. So I talked to my dad and husband. They both told me to do some digging.\nI found out the number when reverse looked up says it belongs to a different business but when I call it is a very sketchy automated voice.\nThen I checked the address they had listed it was for a office building but not there&rsquo;s.\nI kept doing research and I read a story of a different woman kinda in the same situation.\nI didn&rsquo;t hear from them all weekend. Then Monday today comes around and they contact me through email again\nAt this point they know my number, email, which bank I branch with. And my address oh and of course my name.\nMonday they send me a new email changing what they said in previous where they would set up a wallet for me to now, they will send me money to my account and want me to go exchange it to cryptocurrency then show them proof. Right then in there I hopped out of bed replied I was no longer interested that I am content with what I am doing currently (because more money isn&rsquo;t everything)\nAnd then drove to police station to let them know. They told me I was right to be skeptic and good I didn&rsquo;t give them any banking info or continue with giving them any more information or taking money. I got lucky I realized things when I did.",

    "Description": "I answered an ad for a job posted by BeMo Academic Consulting. A female named Jennifer responded back to me. Her email does not indicate her last name. She told me I've been selected to  participate in the application process but before I do, I must agree to a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement. Being that I am actively searching for employment, I agreed. The position was for a Content Developer and encompassed writing, shooting &amp; editing videos and writing content for their blog. This seemed like a great opportunity and something that I could do remotely from home.\nAfter agreeing to the Confidentiality and non-disclosure statement, Jennifer sent me instructions for creating a video and writing a blog post as part of the application process. I was told I had two business days to complete it, however without sacrificing quality, I spent an entire weekend and all of Monday completing the requested tasks.\nSomething didn't feel right so started to look for reviews of the company. I was first met with only 5 star positive reviews. This too didn't seem right that a company would have only 5 star reviews and not one 'con' review. I started digging deeper and searched out reviews for BeMo's 'hiring process' and that is when I found a lot of postings from people who have experienced similar situations. Are they trying to get people to write and produce content and other work for them without actually paying anyone? I'm  not sure exactly but I am not the only one feeling this way.\nOne posting I came across was from an individual who had made it far into the hiring process. He was warning others because after a lot of hard work to meet their requests, they told him the company charges applicants money for training. Sounds like a scam to me.\nI am uploading a copy of the email correspondence I have had with Jennifer - BeMo Academic Consulting. Thank you for your attention to this!",

I haven&rsquo;t ever dealt with anything like that before but these people basically were willing to hire me without interviewing me at all, not even a phone call. When I asked about they said that once I&rsquo;m done signing the contract and agree to work with them that then I&rsquo;ll be able to connect with my would be superiors. Also it was written in the job description that my daily tasks would consist of me using my personal bank account to move and send money to their &ldquo;clients&rdquo;. Through this time I spoke with 2 people Cordelia Robinson, she claimed she was the HR assistant, I spoke with Luke Enderson who didn&rsquo;t mention what his title was at all but I gathered that he is supposed to be some type of manager and all the while I had the emails from these 2 people in my inbox I was later contacted by ANOTHER one of their workers on indeed by the name of Deborah Filtz asking me to send in my resume for that very same position. I should also include that none of these people can be found on any business platform (i.e LinkedIn...) and no information as to the Canadian office location that I &ldquo;would be&rdquo; working at was ever disclosed no matter how I asked. They claimed that because of Covid the office is closed so she didn&rsquo;t feel the need to disclose that info even though at this point they were asking me to sign the contract. I&rsquo;m able to provide and written proof should you need it.",

The business was called Global Solutions Service and someone going by the name Samantha Carlone and then Daniela Lorenz contacted me several times through email about a job position. Without ever having spoken to a real person, they offered me a job as a Financial Administrative Assistant. The position was remote and their last email included paperwork to collect personal information, including my banking information, which they said was necessary for the position so I could process transactions for them. In the email, which were all seemingly automated, there was no address associated with the business, or contact information outside their email. Their website seems very legit, which was most convincing for me, because it looked professionally done and included phone numbers for contact.",

    "BusinessName": "Duden Furnitures",
    "C": "Nov 30, 2020",
    "D": "0.0000",
    "Description": "On November 5, 2020, I applied for the position of Administrative Assistant at a company by the name of Duden Furnitures based out of Germany. I initially found their job posting on LinkedIn.com, and was redirected to ZipRecruiter.com, another job listing site, where I forwarded my resume to them. On November 6, I was contacted by \"Karry Steinier, Head of HR Department (hr@duden.ca)\" asking if I was still interested in the position. On November 9 at 9 AM, I received an email from ZipRecruiter that the job posting has been closed. I hadn&rsquo;t responded to the previous email yet and decided to follow-up with them to see if the position was already filled, saying that I am still very much interested. On the following day on November 10, I was forwarded a job offer to sign before the interview. This seemed out of the ordinary but the email said the signature is a formality before the interview so I read the job offer, which seemed legit, and sent the signed copy back to them on November 12. I heard back from them the same day and was told that I will be contacted by their manager for an interview. On November 16 around 1 PM, I received a call from a number from Edmonton, Alberta (7809132852). When I picked up, a man called \"Billy\" from Duden Furnitures wanted to have an interview with me. I thought it was odd that they didn't schedule a time with me prior to the actual interview but proceeded with it. We talked for about 20 minutes and he said that he would be in touch with me shortly in regards to the application. Almost 2 weeks later on November 27, I received an email from &ldquo;Karry&rdquo; again saying that my application has been approved. The email contained an Employment Agreement Form and a TD1 Form that they asked to sign and return, along with a copy of my photo ID. I was ecstatic that I got the job, got overly excited and returned the signed forms along with a copy of my Ontario Photo ID on November 28. The email didn&rsquo;t have the Job Offer Letter attached to it, and I only thought of re-reading it after sending back the forms. That&rsquo;s when I realized that a part of the letter seemed shady where it said &ldquo;Your company will present you with a debit card for payment operations (5-7 working days). During the probation period, you will be able to receive money in your bank account from our accountant&rdquo;. It seemed strange that my personal bank account was to be involved in company transactions, and I forwarded the job offer to a friend of mine who is a recruiter. He helped me look into the matter and did some research to figure out that this is a scam. On their homepage (www.duden.ca), the links to Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest did not work nor the phone number listed on the website. All the job postings on multiple employment websites had disappeared as well. That&rsquo;s when I realized I had given out my personal information &ndash; SIN number on the TD1 Form and the information on my Photo ID &ndash; to a scammer. At 10 AM on November 30, I received another email from &ldquo;Karry&rdquo; congratulating me for joining their team. It said that my direct head is Purchasing Manager &ldquo;Hailey Errington (purchase@duden.ca)&rdquo; and to contact her to let her know when I can get started and that she will give me all the necessary documents for work. I have not responded to the last email and called the police to see if I can file a report but was told that can only happen if monetary loss has occurred, and was advised to avoid further contact with them. While I haven't lost any money as I didn't actually start working for them, and although it looks like their ulterior motive was to use me for their fake cheque scam rather than steal my personal information, I&rsquo;m concerned it may be misused now that they have access to it. Furthermore, looking through the emails again, I noticed there was another name &ldquo;Voss Moebel&rdquo; written next to Karry Steinier&rsquo;s name, which could only be found in the very first email she sent. I found out that there is an identical website under that name (www.vmoebel.ca) claiming to be a German business with offices in Canada (Quebec) as well as in the US (Nevada). Voss Moebel should be investigated alongside Duden.",

    "Description": "This company was listed on the website Zip Recruiter looking to hire nannies in North Vancouver, Coquitlam, Vancouver, and Toronto. I applied as I already work in childcare and was looking for another childcare position. The morning after my application they called me for a phone interview from a Toronto number. I spoke to a woman, she told me she was calling for a pre-screening interview and asked about my childcare experience, where I was born,  my age, and if I was a student. She also asked if I had a criminal record check, I told her mine was over a year old so I would need a new one. She said I could get a new one for the final in-person interview and that she would email me to set up that interview.\nMinutes later I received an email with a different phone number than the one I was just called by even though the caller had said she would be emailing me. The email said that I was hired and would have a profile put on the website shortly. The email also said the company was BBB accredited and had a company address 538 W 24th street, Vancouver, BC M5R 1B9. I thought it was very strange they would hire me this quickly as I have been hired for this type of position before and when you work with kids you need to be thoroughly vetted. I looked up their business on the BBB and saw that they were not accredited. They also had a separate business address listed 2417 89 Nelson St  Vancouver, BC V6Z 0E7. I went to their website tinyhugs.net (the same website that their hiring email used) and saw a third company address listed 70 Yorkville Ave., Block #2,\nToronto, ONT, M5R 1B9, Email: nanny@tinyhugs.net with a third phone number for their office different than the fourth phone number on the BBB website.\nI went to their Facebook page which has forty-odd reviews all written between August and September, all of the reviewers had accounts from random cities in the states, all with less than fifty (some even had zero) friends. All the reviews had weird English as if they were written by bots and there were no posts for the month of October. The Tiny Hugs BBB profile was created in September as was the document they sent me regarding my nanny contractor terms yet most of the views were written a month before this before they appeared to even be a company.\nOn their website, there were only six women listed as nannies. A google image search of the photos of these women all traced back to stock photos most from the same stock photo site. My friend phoned the phone number listed on the site and a woman answered and said that she was no longer a nanny for the service but could pass her information on to some girls she knows she'd love. This number was supposed to be to the Tiny Hugs matching service that would give families the profile of three nannies that they could have phone interviews with.\nToday November 3, 2020, one day after I received the phone interview I was offered a position for an Avanish family in North Vancouver who wanted an Indian live-out Nanny to care for their ten-month-old five days a week. This email was from the same email account with a different address and a fifth phone number 538 W 24th street, Vancouver, BC M5R 1B9 Canada.\nI looked up this last name in North Vancouver's Yellow Pages and found a man who has no children that clearly would not be looking for a nanny. During my phone interview, I said I wanted a few hours as I was a student and that I couldn't start until next month and had never worked with children under two. Yet they gave me the listing for a position starting soon with an age group I had never worked with and far more hours than I requested.\nAddress break down:\nThe address on the website is for a vacant storefront in Toronto currently available for lease.\nThe address on the BBB is for a unit in the apartment building 'The Arc' in Vancouver.\nThe address in the email they sent me is for an empty lot in Vancouver.\nConclusion: None of the three office addresses are currently owned by Tiny Hugs.",

All I was required to do was fill out the application from with my personal information, and then complete 1-2 initial transactions within the 90 probation period. These transactions were to be done using my personal bank account for \"training purposes\", and after that a corporate account would allegedly be provided to me.\nThe premise was that clients of the company cannot pay the company directly - for a reason the contact was unable to explain to me - so they deposit funds in my account, and then I send to payment on to the company, less my 7% commission. Seems so simple - too good to be true - and extremely inefficient.\nThe phone number on the contact's email signature, as well as the 'company website' does not work.\nThis seems highly likely to be a money laundering front or something.",

I found it odd that she did not have an email address with Combined Insurance in the domain name, and that, in any of the correspondence she sent the client, she did not have a professional email signature with the company's contact information.  I emailed Cheryl to request that a letter of offer be prepared for the client so the client could access employment supports for a record check through ********.  Cheryl did not reply to me, but eventually got back to the client saying she is unable to prepare a letter of offer.  The client said Cheryl said something along the lines of, \"she didn't want to bother their head office with the request.\"  Cheryl had also told the client in previous correspondence that everyone who works for Combined Insurance is contracted so there is no centralized office. I googled the email address Cheryl provided the client and the results came back for a mobile tanning salon called \"Bare Buns,\" in Red Deer, Alberta.\nI advised the client against pursuing employment with Combined Insurance, due to the aforementioned concerns.",

    "Description": "Last week I was contacted by a woman that calls herself \"Clancy\". She said they were hiring for concierge services. So, this entails running different errands for people that are super busy with their lives or unable to do so.\nSo, Clancy sent me a website link: www.chameleonconcirgeservices.com\nI opened it &amp; sure thing looked legit. However, the next day the website was unavailable.\nI even asked her if the company was BBB approved, Of course she said yes. &amp; looking into BBB they were nowhere to be found.\nI was still very curious about what these bunch of women scammers where up to so I played along.\nThe next day they actually sent me a fake bank draft by FEDEX for the amount of $9600 of which I was to take out $4900 to start running the errands.\nI then contacted her via text &amp; said i had the money. Next day she was really trying to get a hold of me &amp; I said I was out running my own errands in public transit. She said I was putting me &amp; her at risk because I had company funds &amp; threatened to call the police.\nAs i wasn't taking any calls she decided to use the Edmonton none emergency police line by spoofing it. I also did not pick that up.\nI then called the number back &amp; it was actually the police number &amp; the officer said scammers spoof any number &amp; no one had called me from their station.\nAnd because of covid &amp; the lack of a personal vehicle, I was supposed to take an uber which they would reimburse for the week at $150. As for the pay, it would be $300 per errand. I was then instructed to make sure my phone was fully charged &amp; I was available on the app called \"whatsapp\" where her \"assistant\" Holly would send me instructions for the errands.\nSo, Holly sent me an address which was at the waves coffee shop by the Palliser.\nI then pretended I was there &amp; called Clancy. She then started asking what machines I could see in the shop. In the meantime, Holly was supposed to send me a barcode which she did but I missed it bcz I was on the phone with Clancy.\nSo, I asked Clancy what I was going to do, she said we would be paying a bill.\nSo, this bill was being paid by the bitcoin machine in Palliser.\nAt that point I lost my cool &amp; started to curse her out &amp; she hang up because she knew they had been busted. Holly quickly blocked me from whatsapp not before me telling her they were good but not the best.\nClancy's number: +12269612097\nHolly's number: +15196942776\nPlease put this story out in the public so that everyone knows there's a bunch of women scammers trying to put people in more debt.\nI have all the emails &amp; texts messages to show as proof.\nFeel free to contact me for more information or if you need clarity on anything.",

In the paper work it asked not for any banking information or other normal paperwork to start a job, but for a credit card number and email to e-transfer funds.

As I waited for the interview I reviewed their company website which looks very legit.  This company is supposed to be responsible for logistics for transportation via land, air and sea to which there are loads of regulations that need to be in place. I received the interview call this morning October 20, 2020, I had lots of questions for the interviewer.  The first question I asked was for more details on the position and how training was set up.  The answer that I was provided with was that there would be a 10 day training period in which I would have to use my own personal bank account to complete company transactions.  Straight away I had alarm bells going off so I told the interviewer that I wasn't comfortable using my own personal account for corporate transactions",

At the very conclusion of my apprenticeship, my employer fired me without compensation or any of the original $ back, and most importantly, unjustly with discriminatory intent (she said my lifelong battle with mild mental illness was a weakness and that I wasn't welcome at the store until I was cured).\nThis in itself seemed a cut and dry case of discrimination with the Alberta labor standards and Human Rights, however, due to the fact that she never technically 'employed' me, there's very little the ALS could do for compensation of a wasted 6 months of income, plus the assurance of subsequent income as an artist in her shop.  I am currently trying to resolve this issue with AHR, however, they are having problems locating the company, because it seems the business is no longer registered.

They still sent me an application, contract and vague job description information. On this paperwork it said Independent Global Leaders, which also came up with zero results when looking. None of the paperwork provided described what the company was. They claim to be based in Saskatoon and opening a new office in Ottawa. I asked them for location details and they couldn't provide that.\nThis could be a legit company with poor recruiting skills, but I couldn't find anything that can be verified.

    "Description": "I was emailed by Melanie Plett, a supposed recruiter for a Logistics company (Wrangler Logistics) based out of Winnipeg, gauging my interest in an available role they had for a Customer Order Processor. Melanie's email correspondence was brief &amp; vague, and the website itself generic and lacking any detail or depth, so I was immediately suspicious but continued cautiously - I was then asked to formally submit an application online, which I did via https://wranglerlogistics.ca/application.php.\nAfter that, Melaine emailed again to confirm my application and set up an interview very quickly, which I agreed to. She called at the agreed time and her approach was immediately suspect - she asked 3 standard interview questions but clearly paid very little attention to my actual answers, and hurried through each one. I seemed to have passed the interview already, because I was then told I would be on a two-week probationary period under the guidance of a manager. I was then told, \"After this period we will allocate you a company bank account, but during this time you're required to process client orders through your own bank account\" At this point I stopped her because I wasn't sure of the full system, but I know it's illegal for companies to process their finances through employees personal bank account - so this front is either gaining access to private bank accounts or is somehow funnelling money through them? I told Melanie I wasn't willing to use my own account for company business and she said ok, if I change my mind let her know. That's all of the correspondence we have.",

Did not contact me from any of the job searching sites (i.e Indeed, etc.) to offer me a position within their company. After mentioning that I am interested, I got a call from them for a 5-10 minute phone interview. Which was following by a job offer to work from home, asking for banking info, and to sign documentation. Now I did my homework before signing any paperwork, or giving away any banking information. The company is nowhere to be found, on Indeed, LinkedIn, BBB, Glassdoor, or any website that would mention a workplace. I even checked the address on Google Maps to try to find the office, nothing. Also searched the names of the people who contacted me to try to find some info, the CEO could not be found on Google or LinkedIn. The only information on the name that I found, was that the company was dissolved in 2012. Before accepting any job offer, make sure to do your research first. I've included the initial email I received. Look out for grammatical errors, and also the minimal requirements needed for such a high paying job. But majorly, look at the email. If it says email via sendgrid.net then it is definitely a scam. If anyone is sending emails through sendgrid, then it should say .com, not .net",

The e-mail closed asking if I would be interested in applying for the position and to respond to her e-mail if so.\nI followed the link to the website and it is very well done and 100% legitimate-looking. I responded to the e-mail asking more anout the job and got a fast reply with most of the same information from the first e-mail restated, as well as a link to an employment agreement. The agreement was via HelloSign and looked less professional.It did not ask me for my social security number or banking information but did ask for my exact address and an electronic signature. It did include a business number: 867603623 which I looked up and it belonged to a Norstan Canada Company, however, it is based out of Winnipeg MB, not North York as it stated in both e-mails and I believe that it is a flooring company not an IT company like the website and job description in the email stated.\nI then went back to the Website and called all of the numbers provided including sales inquiries and tech support to which there was no answer or automated service.The company is also not registered under the BBB website which leads me to believe that it is not a legitimate company and that this is a scam to obtain my SIN number and banking information.\nIt is a shame if it is fake because It would have been my families saving grace.

I couldn't find any contact numbers to verify these details\nThe person who contacted was \"Tiffany Jonas\" with email \"hr@norstan.ca\"\nThere is a LinkedIn profile by this name which looks to be fake as well as an organization page by this name which also looks fake.\nThe website www.norstan.ca seems like a copy of a Montreal based company http://ingrix.com/index.html, not sure if this is also fake.",

    "Description": "I have been told that this is the BEST cam modeling site in the world! I was told that the money I make is mine, but then when I found out via a phone call that the models only take home 20% of what they are supposed to make and the company takes 80% - that's highway robbery! Next I find out that I haven't gotten paid! I understand that they would take a cut, but not 80%! This is also NOT written on the website of the platform that they use to stream! All it says on the website is that the models / performers get a part of the amount, but NOT 20% ONLY.... Next to find out the 80% goes to OTHER models who make the top 5..... so they are using my money to buy gifts and trips to other models.... not fair.....\nI didn't work for free and all of the other models are getting paid, so I need my money!\nAs per what I'm told I'm supposed to get is $434.25 US (this is my 20%), but what I actually want is my full amount that I worked those hours for, which in total comes out to $1,789.32! Not to mention the leg work to get my money, because I haven't yet received any payment from them - so my settlement that I want form them at Paradise Kitty is $2500.00 US for all of this trouble.\nI only worked on this site to get extra money to help pay off my debts, but if I had known in advance that they take 80%, I wouldn't have applied to be a model on this site! I found out 2 weeks later (after the date that I started) that the models only get 20% of the pay!\nAnother thing that I was told is that I could apply for direct deposit, but that's not the case - I was informed then about a wire transfer and that was supposed to happen on Saturday, and it hasn't! So, in lieu to this, I am asking for the full payment in the form of a check of $2500.00 USD so that I can get everything back that I earned! I will never bother them again after this.\nThe person in contact is Tommy Gibbs - the second number is his cell phone number, and he says that this is his company. I want my money that's owed to me so that I can finish paying what I need to pay.\nDo NOT go with this site - they are not honest! They also haven't had me fill out a W4 Form for tax purposes, so he may be doing tax evasion as well. I know in the states they need to provide that.",

They followed up with a seemingly impressive job offer and said I fit their profile, but the job seemed to require next to no real skills and no education, while I have a masters in physics. I asked where they got my info and they ignored me the first time but the second time told me they receive info from multiple companies and couldn't tell me where.\nThey sent me an application via their seemingly legit website (although in my own searches I was unable to find this online, and the only mention of the company was on a registry website) and the application was riddled with bad grammar, although didn't ask for anything most job applications don't (and trust me, I've filled out _a lot_ of job applications).\nAll in all, I've been applying left and right for even decent entry level jobs to no avail, so an offer for somewhere I didn't apply seemed highly suspect. Everything about it was suspicious, but it took me a bit to decide with certainty it was a scam, as the whole thing was really quote well done. The email format followed standard formats with real hr departments I've spoken with, the job description was in a familiar format, and the phone number, registered company address and stated address all lined up. Something about it felt off since the beginning, but it took a few emails before I was convinced it was fake",

    "Description": "This company reached out to me claiming to be offering an opportunity to become one of their brand ambassadors in exchange for free jewelry, via Instagram direct messaging. This seemed unusual to me as I only had a small Instagram account, with only a few photos of me on it, most of it was of nature - an odd choice for a jewelry company. The catch seems to be that you are expected to pay for the shipping. They also explicitly stated that there was no contract, which to me seemed suspicious as that almost always benefits the company, not the freelancer. Once I responded to the Instagram direct message, I was flooded with responses from the supposed \"Brand Manager\". Again, strangely eager. When I said \"I think this is a scam\", they responded with a stock message about \"understanding my hesitations\", even though I had directly accused them of being a scam and using classic \"brand ambassador\" scam tactics. I imagine a real brand would take great exception to being called a scam and simply stop messaging that potential ambassador - they didn't seem to mind at all. I hope others have not been caught up in this, as even after I searched the internet for information on whether this was a legit opportunity or a scam, nothing came up. I can see how enticing this is. Thanks for your help.",

I asked if it was legal and she stated yes it was but I felt uncomfortable and contacted the Better Business Bureau and they indicated more than likely this was not a legitimate practice and they had heard of similar schemes. I asked Samantha to destroy my information and that I was uncomfortable with this as it sounded like money laundering. She said she would destroy my information but I will contact my bank and passport office to ensure that my information will not be compromised.",

I emailed back saying I'd like more information on the job and company. They sent me the website address and I checked everything out. I applied and was contacted about a phone interview for the next day. During the interview, they started off asking typical questions like \"Do you have experience in this role? What was the last position you held and how long were you there for? What are your 3 biggest strengths?\" Everything seemed fine until she started talking to me as if I'd already gotten the position &mdash; no talking it over with others, no offering it to me and letting me have the final say. Then she explained that I would be doing a two week trial reporting directly to a manager. During that two weeks, they would get me set up with a company bank account, but it would take the full two weeks so I'd be paying all invoices through my own personal bank account. I told her I was not comfortable with that, and she replied it was a requirement of the job. I made it clear this was not going to work and hung up.",

All communication was conducted through email only. They are really adamant only having contact through email only. As the application proceeded I found a few things to be out of the ordinary. I immediately noticed the website was a fake especially with the photos of their personnel. I even know the website they used to obtain  photos of their so-called employees. I called the phone number provided on the application and it would go dead, not even an answering machine. I even called during their stated business hours which is 9-5 and still the line went dead. I looked up the Mississauga address provided on the application and the address appears to need a unit number for it to be valid.\nI was emailed an employment agreement form in which case i had requested to speak to a real person. I was sent an email in response to my request which stated i have to sign the form and then Mary Patterson would reach out by phone. I replied that I would not be signing anything unless I speak with a person, specifically Mary Patterson. It's been most 2 weeks since and nobody has contacted by email or phone.\nAccording to the emails. I was communicating with Mary Patterson. I honestly believe there is no such individual.\nThe person that was communicating with me is not a native English speaker. With a name like Mary Patterson it is highly unlikely for major grammatical errors to occur.\nI also noticed that the website bssinc.ca was registered on a server June 17th 2020 which happens to be a whole 6 days before I was contacted for a job opening, which is strange because according the website they have been in business for the last 5 years.\nIf they truly have been in business for that long the company would have much more of a presence on the internet. I had a hard time finding any information about the company and what they actually do as an organization.\nI am more than happy to send the rams that were sent to me by broadway staffing solutions",

They promised full benefits, Lots of vacation pay and life insurance. Promising above average pay at $49-$57 an hour. I replied that I was interested so I could gather some information to determine whether it was a legitimate business or not, and she asked me in the following email to fill out an application and send it back. I was not about to give them any of my information but after extensive research online I found that it is a phishing scam. They also had my old last name and email address so I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure where they even got my information from or how they knew that I was looking to change careers.

The only reply I got was directing me to send my resume to another company. So I did, thinking they had used some sort of staffing agency for something. I was contacted by \"Kayla Alexander\" who sent me a long email with horrible grammar and strangely phrased sentences (see attached) which struck me as odd because her LinkedIn profile says she has a Masters degree from McGill. They were offering 1080/week CAD, for full time work and said it's a remote work from home job for a Customer Service Agent.\nAt this point, I went to their website which touts the likes of Tim Hortons, Audi, RBC, etc as clients. I looked up their address in google maps and it appears to be a run down mall with no office space nearby. They couldn't even be bothered to type out the full postal code. I then called the number (within \"business hours\") and a robotic male voice with a british accent basically gives you the run around and ultimately tells you to leave a message.\nBy this time \"Kayla\" had emailed me back with more information telling me that the probation period is basically just simple tasks used to \"assess\" work. There are also strict stipulations about not doing any \"side issues\" and having to be in constant contact with the supervisor during business hours. They never interviewed me, just read my resume (presumably) and then offered me a ridiculous amount of money for what should be a minimum wage job.\nI've attached the screen shot of the original email reply, but I have saved the messages if needed in the future. They don't have any information other than what is on my resume, and I didn't click the link sent to me to \"register\".",

The position needed no prior experience and the job title was vague.\nWhen I conducted a background research, I found some results but was not sure if it was this company. They had not provided me their company website in their email.\nI signed some contracts and agreed to work with them. They asked for my passport first page which I did not give. But sadly, I was dumb enough to give me a scanned copy of my driver's license.\nThey suggested that I make a telegram account and that is where most of the job-related communication happened after I accepted the job offer. In the job offer, I was told that this was a remote position and but I was told to commute on my first job task.\nThey claimed that they had made some bitcoin accounts for me and needed me to withdraw the money they sent me on my bank account. I had already visited a convenience store to \"activate\" my bitcoin account by depositing $20 dollars. It was after this I had to go withdraw the cash from my local TD bank after which I was instructed to deposit that money into a Bitcoin machine. I was also instructed to not tell the teller at the bank that I was withdrawing for bitcoin.\nAfter I had deposited the money into the bitcoin machine and had the receipt, I got an email from them instructing me to call a certain number to complain that the money was not deposited. When I refused to do so, because I was being told to lie, I suspected this was all a scam. After I sent the manager a reply strictly saying no, she replied in an unprofessional manner and tone threatening me that this was my job and I was on my \"trial period' and that I have to do this. I immediately left the place and went home. Later, I replied that I cannot continue the job while travelling as I had no transportation of my own and had to take transit.\nAfter that, they had released some money to my bank account which I refused to pay back and threatened them that I was going to report them. I did not accept the deposit in my bank account and eventually the deposited money got cancelled.\nAfter that, I did not hear back from them.",

Hmmm.\nI am highly experienced and this job would have been very needed and a perfect opportunity for my family and I (I also would have been a GREAT asset to the position). It is really unfortunate that these opportunities are not realistic and sad that people still prey on others like this.",

    "Description": "I was applying to jobs at the end of May 2020 knowing that I could be laid off due to COVID-19. I was searching for jobs on indeed.ca and saw a job opportunity for an \"Administrative Assistant\" position. I applied for the position and about a week later received an e-mail that stated:\nGood Morning,\nThank you for applying for the Administrative Assistant position we posted on www.indeed.ca. While we have recently suspended filling the said position as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, do find below a safe and temporary position that might interest you:\nCOVID-19 EVALUATOR\nThis position is structured with COVID-19 safety measures in mind, it is part time and an opportunity for professionals, students and self employed individuals who are currently not working (or working) and would want to earn an additional income.\nWith the current Global Pandemic going on, we are looking for Evaluators to assess firms in major cities in Canada. Reporting to the Evaluation Recruiting Officer (ERO), (the) COVID-19 evaluator will be required to assess whether or not safety measures instituted by WHO and currently being implemented by the Canadian Government is being followed in order to flatten the COVID-19 curve.\nEach COVID-19 Evaluator will require a client review and protected client site visit. All evaluations are accessible via public transit.\nCOVID-19 Evaluator(s) are compensated for at the rate of Three Hundred Dollars ($300) per evaluation. Up to 3 evaluations are available weekly throughout the month of May.\nQualifications:\nAble to maintain strict confidentiality\nHealth Conscious\nEffective communication skills (both written and oral)\nAbility to follow directions, memorize scenario and recall them as needed\nAble to be objective and unbiased\nAccess to a computer and internet\nDuties:\nAfter an Evaluation, the COVID-19 Evaluator completes a survey answering specific questions based on his/her observations and deductions during the evaluation.\nIf this position interests you, kindly reply with the number of Evaluation you are able to carry out weekly. There is a minimum of one and maximum of three available weekly.\nA recently completed COVID-19 Evaluation sample would be sent to you afterwards for a better understanding.\nAlso, do note that each Evaluation would take approximately two hours to be completed.\nWarm Regards,\nI didn't think anything about the e-mail at first since he seemed very professional. I then requested for the \"employer\" to send me more details on the position. He responded:\n\"Thank you for your continued interest in becoming our COVID-19 Evaluator. Once you are approved, your position as COVID-19 Evaluator would commence with immediately.\nBelow are additional relevant details in moving forward with your application:\nIf approved, your remuneration of $300 per evaluation would be sent along with your evaluation package. Also, we will be covering all the incurable costs that would /might arise from every evaluation assigned.\nYour evaluation would include visiting outlets designated as essential services like Restaurants, Banks, Grocery Stores, Walmart etc to determine whether safety measures instituted by WHO and currently being implemented by the Canadian Government are being adhered to.\nAn evaluation package would always be mailed to you via courier with contents like specific instructions to follow, assigned store/organization, a certified cheque, and an evaluation report sheet.\nA Mandatory 24 hours vulnerable sector check is required at this stage and upon successful completion - your first evaluation would be assigned.\nAttached is a sample report from a completed evaluation to get you familiar with the position.\nBelow are the requested details needed to carry out the 24 hours vulnerable sector check:\n- Full Name as stated on your ID:\n- Mailing Address (INCLUDING UNIT #) and postal code:\n- Employment Status:\n- Phone/Fax number:\n- Age:\n- Sex:\nIt seemed a little fishy since each evaluation would only take up to 2 hours and I would get paid $300. It seemed too good to be true. He also never called me to discuss the opportunity further. I sent him my information and he then told me he would send me my first evaluation package in the mail with instructions on how to proceed. He told me the package contains instructions for my first evaluation and a cheque issued by our financier (sponsoring the evaluations) - RIGMASTER POWER INTERNATIONAL LTD. It didn't make sense since I would be doing my first evaluation check at Walmart and the company sponsoring the evaluations was a manufacturer of auxiliary power units for the trucking industry. It didn't add up.\nHe sent me a tracking number and my package arrived a couple of days later. He told me to phone him once I received it.\nHe sent me an \"evaluation report sheet\" and instructions that stated:\nSTEP 1: DEPOSIT- deposit the cheque in your account to enable you to access funds for Step 2 and 3. make a cash withdrawal of $3400 for Step 3 bank deposit evaluation. Send me a clear picture of your withdrawal receipt via e-mail.\nSTEP 2: WALMART ASSESSMENT- At your discretion, make any purchase from any Walmart stores to enable you to complete the assessment page below.\nSTEP 3: BANK DEPOSIT EVALUATION- A specific bank outlet would be sent yo you once the withdrawal receipt has been provided.\nI didn't follow through with any of it as I realized that I was being scammed. I'm reporting this so this doesn't happen to other innocent people, ESPECIALLY during a pandemic.\nThank you for reading!",

At that point I confirmed 100% that it was a scam and just hung up.",

    "Description": "Fake employment offer. I never contacted this company while job searching and was contacted by the 1st email. I responded without details to get the job description and received the 2nd email which contained the job offer. I was skeptical due to the poor grammar, vague and confusing job detail, the mentioning of a bank account in the job description, and the offer without an interview. With these red flags I looked up website and could not find it on google search alone. The website from the link in the email looks professional, but again details of a business would be confusing for a client to contact them. From LinkedIn, I found the one director which seems legit, but with a Toronto address. I looked up the company location and could not find the company registered to that building with office space for rent. From the registration of the company with the gov't, it registers at an Oakville address. When I looked up the name Tammy Faulkner from Barrie, ON, I found the BBB listed scam. The name was used with Eventis Management Consulting offering a similar employment scam with the address from Barrie being the same despite the very many years claimed to have worked for Koncam. This was the end of my research on this particular scam and I did not waste any more time on this topic, other then to advise BBB. I did not attempt to make any further contact for risk of giving away any personnel information.

They sent me a contract to sign and called me for a 5 minute interview and said i would go thru a 2 week \"training\" program.  They asked me to set up an app \"Telegram\" to be able to send me my tasks. First task was to send them details to rent 2 spaces 700-1700 feet.  2nd task was to take out $50 out of my account and go to local bank (they provided) for me to convert to bitcoin and they would refund me in 2-3 days.  They advised that their company deals in this currency and want to ensure i know how to do this. When i refused to do this task and questioned it, they asked why did i sign contract to work for them and said they do not want \"lazy employees\" and would terminate my contract.  As soon as i advised i am not continuing with any training, then deleted all correspondence on \"Telegram\".",

I then received a phone call saying that I am a successful candidate and will be contacted by a representative.  I was sent an employment agreement which is filled out and signed.  I then started what I thought was legitimate work but in fact is completely fraudulent.  They are frauding peoples bank accounts. They sent etransfers into my account and adked me to buy bitcoin.  As I was on the 5 day probation period, I thought they didn&rsquo;t want to open a business account for me until I passed the probation period. They assured me they will open me an account when I expressed concerns over my personal account being used for business.  Embarrassingly enough, I fell for it.  I was quite excited to find a job online as I had my work halted until further notice due to COVID-19. I thought this was the new way to do business and felt blessed to have found a job during this time where I can remain safe.  I could not have been more wrong.  I am horrified at this whole situation and do not want others to fall for this thinking they were doing something good and finding out later it is fraudulent.  I cannot express in words how horrible this is.  I have huge bank problems now and am exhausting all resources that I can think of to protect others from experiencing this horrible situation at this horrible time when we are all so vulnerable.  Please do not fall for this and be wary.  I truly wish I was more wary and did not place my trust so easily.",

This professed business owner brought me here to what I believed was a career opportunity of a lifetime. I have been hugely misled and conned. This person is trying to promote this Seattle-based business here in Saudi Arabia &amp; hoping to expand to other countries in the Middle East. After my unpleasant dealings with him all of March here, I have discovered that this person is a con-artist. I have seen lie after lie about any business or any proofs of the services it provides. Most of all, I have heard directly from his mouth lie after lie. This is a dangerous manipulative man who after confronting him numerous times here, became angry, insulted me and slandered me, and on top of everything else, abandoned his responsibility as sponsor during this COVID crisis. He bailed out of trying to further accommodate me or help me return home to Canada before the travel ban went up here in Saudi Arabia. I have notified the other parties (educational professionals &amp; universities) here in Saudi Arabia with whom we met and whom this Mr. Umal Ahmed (not his real name) has lied to. I bring forth great concern about a manipulative dangerous lying professed education consultant with a business called Macademics based in Seattle, Washington, USA. The details of the party I am greatly concerned about are:  Macademics/ Education Consultant/ macademics.net / http://www.millenniumacademic.com/ https://www.macademics.net/leadership-team /Umal Ahmed / info@macademics.net / Umal4122@gmail.com / 0500558243 / +1 206.397.9055 / 6951 Martin Luther King Jr. Way S. Ste. 221 / Seattle, WA 98118/ Umal Ahmed - https://www.linkedin.com/in/umal-ahmed-99b1b1a2/ This is someone who is hugely money hungry and a manipulative person who after arriving here in Saudi Arabia, realized the con-artist I was dealing with. This person had emotionally toyed with me all of March and now am stranded here. Then during the onset of COVID, jeopardized my safety by trying to remove me from the hotel he was paying for me to stay at and when I refused to have anything to do with him or go anywhere with him he abandoned me. Now I am left in another country during the coronavirus pandemic and stuck with the cost of all things. I was forced to contact the Canadian Embassy immediately. I am safe now from this man but it did not come without severe mental anguish. Mr. Umal Ahmed is not his real name and his professed business Macademics is not really in existence as he is claiming with many of us around the world. This person and business is highly suspicious.",

    "Description": "I was sent an email outlining a position as an \"Administrative Assistant\" for Global Education Community (details attached) The position started at $25/hr and then went to $30/hr after 30 days of probation. I was a little skeptical about the pay but I thought I would continue with the role as a work at home position was ideal for with the whole COVID-19 pandemic going on. I was sent the paperwork and registration after the manager \"Serena C**\" asked me a few questions about the position a day/two later. The questions were informal just asking about my availability and being able to work from home until the supposed \"office\" opens in London Ontario by the end of April.\n2-3 days later I was sent my assignment which was to create a PowerPoint 25-30 slides outlining my city or province to impress and entice their \"students\" to visit Canada. I was given 3 days to complete the assignment and was asked to work the typical 9-5. I thought that was more than enough time for me to complete this presentation as it was a pretty light set of expectations, but maybe that's just me.\nAfter completing the assignment I was later sent the second assignment send about 2 hours later with an even lighter workload and about a week to complete. It was to research cheap hostels or hotels and record about 25 of them including accommodations, price, facilities, etc. The research was to be used for newly arriving international students who haven't been assigned campus housing.\nBefore I began the second assigned I thought I'd do some further digging into the company's website. I discovered that one of their so-called partners \"Air Canada\" was not listed as being their partner on their website. More after, I contacted Serena about my concern and she never replied to my messages or returned one of my calls. Therefore, my advice is to confirm the company is 100% legitimate before you commit to begin your work even in times of desperation to secure your time is being honoured by wage/salary and not completely nothing.",

    "Description": "I would like to file a complaint of a business opportunity that was offered to me by the agents of the company called - WORLD FINANCIAL GROUP (WFG) . Initially I was approached by this agent VISHAL PATEL assuring me of making passive income by becoming an insurance broker and selling insurance policies to people and he told me that I need to recommend this business opportunity to my friends and family members and bring in 3 referrals within 1 month and have a chance of winning $750 and a free Vegas trip to attend the WFG convention. It was clearly stated by the agent that WFG is not a multi level marketing company and then I was enrolled in the company by paying joining fee of  $141.25 CAD and Vegas convention registration fee of  $185.00 USD. I was called on to attend the weekly meetings and then later was told by the agent that I need to talk to my friends and family about this opportunity and tell them that this is doing wonders for me . I was also told to provide 10 phone numbers of people whom I know as referrals.I was not happy lying to my friends and family and misguiding them by telling them that I am doing very well in this business and making a fortune out of it .Then the agent VISHAL PATEL called me over the phone and told me that in order to succeed in this business I have to lie to people and tell them that this business is working wonders for me. The next surprise was when I was called for a meeting on the pretext that I will be given some training and education as the company requires every employee to have a Life License Qualification license (LLQP) and WFG helps each employee get this license. And when I had the meeting with the SMD - Senior Marketing Director of the company RAJEEV BHATIA, I was asked to buy the insurance policies from him. This came as a big shocker to me and I was very disappointed when I realized that I myself need to buy the insurance products of the company which was hidden from me right from the start. I was never informed initially that I have to buy the policies myself . I refused to buy any policy as I didn't need it and so the SMD asked me NOT come to this company anymore. I left the company and then made calls to the agent VISHAL PATEL. Unfortunately he kept rejecting my calls and kept sending me messages that he is busy and that he will call back. Till date he has never called back. Also in the AMA agreement documents of the company my signature is false. I would request the authorities to investigate into this matter and I need the full refund of the registration fee and convention fee and damages for representing my  false signatures . I also saw RAJEEV BHATIA recording my credit card details in the meeting and when I questioned he said it is the company policy. Do companies like WFG have the legal right to record customers credit card details including CVV # and expiry date?",

He said he had a job offer where he could give me 200 a day for doing errands for him. He told me for my name and email, I gave it to him and he sent me a cheque worth 1500 using mobile cheque deposit where you get sent a cheque by email that you deposit using the banks app, with his cheques being sent by his \"accountant\". He told me to etransfer him 1100 to his \"cousin\". He then made me open up a Scotiabank account so I could deposit these cheques. He would then send me cheques everyday and I would give the money to him in the form of bitcoin in total he sent me $3900 by cheque and j have him $2100 by etransfer or bitcoin.  And march 2 and 3, the cheques he gave to me we either returned or counterfeit. Afterwards he kept asking me to open an RBC account which I did not do. When I confronted him about the cheques, he told me the cheque was in review by the bank and that his cheques were always legit. He also kept telling me that he loved me and he would never lie or do anything bad to me. The scammer and his\"accountant\"would also always make new instagram accounts every 1-3 days to contact me from. He also asked me one time to give him my banking username and password so he could solve all my problems which I refused to do. On March 14 2020 he told me that I needed to send him $500 in bitcoin or else he would lose $71000 but I also denied it. Recently he messaged saying to give him steam and Google play gift cards or else he would call the police on me and get me arrested, so blackmailing me into giving him bitcoin, which I have not done. The last working Instagram account he contacted me with was Richard.carter777777. The personal info I lost was my full name and email only.",

    "Description": "I was contacted by a woman [ March 2, 2020 from the number (519) 636-5581 ] from a company called Concierge Service Group Inc. (201 Front St N #400, Sarnia ON. N7T 7T9) about an employment offer as an errand runner/service provider. After an interview conducted over the phone I was offered a position where I was told I would make $900.00/week working for multipe businessles and CEO's running whatever errands they would need (ex. grocery shopping, reservations, bill paying, etc.). I was told I was being sent a check for $8,700.00 and this would include my first $900.00 for training. I got the check after 2 days after providing them with my address and ended up taking it to the bank on March 6, 2020. \"Miranda\" [phone numbers: (343-989-0102) or (587-777-9954) ] from Concierge Service Group Inc. told me to deposit the check as it was pre-verified and would allow me to take cash out right away. When I tried to deposit the cheque, the bank teller at RBC told me that there would be a 4 day hold on the check and I could only withdraw $750.00 for now. I proceeded to withdraw the $750.00 from the bank as instructed to carry out my first \"training assignment\". I was instructed to take the money to *******&nbsp;Convenience Store in Calgary, AB and use their Bitcoin machine there for my assignment. I was provided a barcode from \"Miranda\" from \"Concierge Service Group Inc.\" for a \"bill payment\" and used it to transfer the cash over into cryptocurrency directly to somebody else. I was told my \"training\" would continue when the check was cleared but after my suspicion rose about the situation I reported it to the bank. I genuinely thought it was a legitimate employment and I had zero intention of doing anything fraudulent at all. I am now responsible for dealing with the $750.00 I withdrew before I can access my banking. I am really hoping to get this situation resolved as I have been a victim of a scam and robbery of money I now owe to the bank. I have proof of all of the text messages, e-mails, phone calls and whatsapp messages/calls and proof that I am innocent and was completely unaware that this job opportunity was a scam. I am reporting this so that others can be forewarned about this employment scam and make the right decision to not get involved!",

I was told to set up the telegram app and add Kimberly R*** and she would conduct an interview through that app. They go through the job description salary benefits etc. and then ask you several questions. Then you&rsquo;re told to hold while they get it approved. They come back telling you that you&rsquo;re approved and can start immediately due to the high demand of work out there. Then they ask you to have your printer ready so they can email you a check and then you can add it through your mobile banking app. This check is supposedly to buy equipment needed for the job. Then they ask you for all your banking information. This is when I stopped the communication. They never answer any of the questions you ask like why there is no personal interaction. The whole process was way too quick which is why I started getting concerned. Beware",

    "Description": "Good day, i received an offer of employment from the above mentioned company, even though i have not send them any application. The offered salary was to good to be true, i tried verifying the company by searching through the internet. Not much information i got however i found out that they have a website. Then later i got a call from the telephone number mentioned on their website, they even explain how the company operates, that they have a warehouse in the US, and since they are expanding in North America they have  put up an office in Halifax since its near the port, they also mentioned that they have the full cooperation of Halifax port authority and in the future they are planning to put an office here in Fredericton, New Brunswick.  With that, i somewhat feel like it is a legit company, they sent me a contract (sample attached) and asked me to send any valid ID and my SIN for tax purposes. After sending all the document they then ask me further information like credit card info and bank account info, and to signed another document called direct deposit and outsourcing authorization form (sample attached),  they mentioned that if i give the credit card info i will receive more bonuses. After giving them again all the information, they then ask me if i know how to process BitCoin. which i told them i dont know. They said its not a problem, since they will instruct me how to do it as part of my training. I ask them what is the purpose of BitCoin, they said that it is the latest and cost effective way to do trading transaction and as an authorize agent i should know how to do it. then they said monday next week, which is today they will give me my very first task. I was thinking about the validity of this business the whole weekend, asking my friends and family. Most of them said it must be a scam. I check there website this morning and it was not accessible and their telephone line is out of reach. this confirmed my doubt. Then i message telling them that i am waiting for there next instruction. after maybe 2 hours they replied and the website is now up and the telephone has now a ringtone. then i got the message from them, my first task which is to go to the nearest Bitcoin ATM machine and deposit a 20 CAD then i need to send them a picture of the receipt in the machine with the code in order for them to verify that i have completed the task. Since im totally convince that this is a scam, i just said Yes to it,  but i will never do it. i alerted my bank about the case. And look for a way in the internet to report the scam. which i found this site. The scammer is still following up with me by repeatedly calling and messaging me, if i have completed the task given. I really hope that you can do something in order to stop this scammer from ruining peoples lives. Thank You.",

    "Description": "The scammed initially contacted me with a work from home employment opportunity, using the name, Natalie Aarons. Claiming to be a HTC manager, at Crypto Currency Ventures, inquiring about a short phone interview. I recieve a call from a Florida phone number, from a man, stating Natalie was unavailable for the phone interview.  It really wasn't an interview at all, he just described the job details and stated I woks receive an email shortly with the employment agreement and other online documents to be completed ASAP. I received an email shortly after, with documents attatched. One was an employment agreement, as well as a direct deposit form requesting my bank information and etransfer info. The email also requested that I send a picture of myself holding my drivers license. I wrote an email back, requesting more information about the company, etc. Received a couple emails back, none of which answered my question about the company, just sending me a link to the \"corporate website\". When  I tried to email the \"corporate email address\", provided on the website, my email was rejected. I researched the email address IP, and the geolocation came up as Russia, on several websites.  I also researched the address provided on the website (801 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL), and it comes up as a \"virtual office space\". Which means literally anyone can pay to use this address as a buisness address for their virtual buisness. My last email to \"Natalie Aarons\", I stated i was going to report this company, and received no reply.  I should also note that I requested to speak with, Natalie Aarons, personally... several times. And never once spoke to a female.  I caught on to the scam, before I gave out any valuable information.  Otherwise, I'm certain I would have become a victim to identity theft, or worse.",

I corresponded a bit with the person to gather more information and did some research to see if in fact it was real or a scam.\n- Two emails from them had poor spelling and many grammar mistakes.\n- I have inspected their website and have called the number on the site, 902-400-1339, a voice msg says \"you have reached a text mail subscriber\"; and the mobile # that texted me, 807-788-2400, has a recorded msg saying \"this number does not accept phone calls\".\n- The company name on the job posting doesn't match the business name that I corresponded with nor the website name.\n- I Google mapped the address in Halifax shown on the website and also Google mapped their address in New York and became more suspicious (check it out - 5162 Duke St Halifax, NS and 630 Fifth Avenue,New York, NY).\n- This website looks VERY similar to one in Singapore: http://drivensg.com/ - i do not know if this one is a scam or if they just copied the site.\n- This was supposed to be for a professional driver position and not once did the individual ask for my driver's abstract.\n- They haven't asked for any personal banking information yet but I would expect that would be their next step as that wish to pay me $2,885 up front!!\n- There are names and pictures of 4 people on the website - none of which have a Facebook or LinkedIn account.

    "Description": "I got a call from \"Peter James\" on Thursday 13th Feb, 2020 around 2:37PM from \"647 775-1554\". He invited me for an interview. It looked cool, so I wen for it on Friday Feb 14th at 1:30pm at  &ldquo;3250 Bloor St West Suite #600 East Tower -Toronto&rdquo;.\nI did not know until I reached there it was an agency so I felt little weird because they asked me to fill a form, which I did but I was little uncomfortable with it. Then Peter James, took me to his office, he asked for my availability, I said that I work on campus already and full time student and hence I cannot work more than 20h off campus, I actually didn't go for a job, but I fell for it.\nThen he signed me up on a website called  oneclicktalent.net where he created my account with basic info such as address, DOB, height, weight etc.  Then he clicked my photo with his phone and uploaded, that was another skeptical point, he said only he can upload photo. He had the login and password for the account that he created for me, which is basically a job posting kind of website. He told me this website had monthly fee of $14 something and he kind of rushed through it and didn't explain me much about the policies. Then he asked me to pay him $100 upfront, which I did through e-transfer to his email \"bighousetalentsix@gmail.com\". He said they are shooting at York University tomorrow and if I am available, I said yes I am available, so he wrote my name.\nThen I left the office and on the subway, I checked the email from \"oneclicktalent\" about the agreements which said that I cannot opt out from before 8-months and I had to pay monthly fee which they deduct through my bank account as I gave them my DDF (Direct Deposit Form). When I read it was 8-month long and I didn't have the option to opt out, I ran back to his office, but he had left by the time I reached, then I called him and I said I no longer want to be a part of this, he said to call him tomorrow since he is busy.\nI kept reading online, and through reddit I came across a post which somebody had shared and had gone through exact same thing, and that was very shocking to me and I started worrying about it. So I called TD Bank around 10pm and told them about the situation since I wasn't feeling good about it, they verified the \"One Click Talent\" said it's not verified through BBB and hence it's a red flag. They told me to cancel my account to be safe which I did and I opened a new checking account to keep my money safe at the TD branch on Steels by York University. In the morning of Feb 15th, 2020 I called \"One Click Talent\" at +1 877 228 8026, and I told them to cancel the subscription, they said they cannot do that since the agent had signed me up for 8-month, which is weird for them to know as I didn't tell them my name on the call. They said I had to contact my agent \"peter\" and they couldn't do anything, and I had to send them a letter to cancel, and only then they can cancel after 8 months. I felt really worried, so I also informed the police about this as I didn't want to get into any risk in the future. I called back \"Peter James\" around noon on Feb 15th, 2020 and informed that I want to quit this and he got angry at me on the phone and shouted, and I felt really uncomfortable on the call, and when I asked for refund of $100 he cut the phone.\nAt this moment, my account is safe and money as well. I took the necessary steps based on what my TD bank told me to stay safe, but I am worried since they cannot take money from my account and they denied to cancel my account on \"One Click Talent\", they might claim in future the money as a collection. I didn't sign any agreement physically on any paper nor did I sign any contract, but I am worried as I don't want to end up in any illegal scenario in the future. Hence I am informing BBB about it.

    "Description": "A Hiring manager named Mary Lusk reached out to m claiming she found my resume on the indeed job board, so I thought it was legitimate.  She began communication with me via email trying to coerce me into the operations manager position (remote position) with the CNC imports llc company. She eventually wanted to move the conversation to chatting on the telegram messenger app and so we had conversations on there that made me so skeptical. She had already sent me the job offer and then asked me to fill out the job agreement forms she had sent me on the app. Then I had several concerns about the job agreement and how it didn't match the job offers benefits. Mary then claimed it was their lawyers who created the agreement so it couldn't be changed. Even more skeptical she said that there would be a voice interview following me signing the agreement. I knew something was off but I wanted to catch her lying and report the scam on here so I proceeded with what she wanted. After signing and sending it back there she asked when I was available for a voice interview and I gave her the time. When she called me the interview was 3 questions and she sounded like she was reading from a script. Seamless to say it lasted for 1 minute and 50 seconds.  From there I said I'm calling her back to ask her more questions and it went to automated voice mail. From there I researched more about the Canada location in Halifax and called the building and asking if there was a company called CNC imports llc renting space in this building and they said there was no such company in the building. I messaged Mary on telegram cause she was always online and confronted her saying I had more questions to ask following the short telephone interview. I followed by saying I called the Halifax location to see if it was legitimate and began to say there was no such company renting in the building, needless to say after not complying with signing the following TD1 forms and security check forms she blocked me from the app and deleted the conversation. I however took screenshots of the convo well before she deleted them. I even had her profile picture saved as I wanted to warn other potential victims of this so called \"HR manager\".",

At first I thought it was weird that the interview was through messaging (google hangouts)and no phone call and the fact that the company was based out of the states also it was After the messaging interview was done Daniel said to contact him on Monday to find out if I got the position. So I got the position and after a little discussion and offering that everything that I need for my home office was going to be free/reimbursement and this included and 4 in 1 printer a Mac book air 2019 and any software or security I needed. But my first step was to go buy $1000 worth of Google play cards for my software security and he had sent me a cheque via email, and during all of this he was super pushy kept calling and texting to check if I got the cards and paper printed. So I had called my bank about other reasons but they brought to my attention that this was all a scam. And now I am taking the necessary steps to protect myself, since he has ALL MY INFORMATION. He also ordered a phone he wanted me to use for work through Bell.  HIS NAME IS DANIEL LIMON AND SAYS HE WORKS FOR ROC OFF PRODUCTIONS. THIS INDIVDUAL DOES NOT!!!!!",

Which I also did. Then I was told that my first assignment was to an odd location, but I went to the location and was instructed to find a machine (bitcoin) and deposit the $4,900.00 into the machine. I still had no clue that this was wrong. Then the bitcoin ran out of credits, so I was instructed to go to the next bitcoin machine and continue with my deposit, once again i did this. Then i was told that my first assignment&nbsp;was complete. I was confused because I did not help anyone. Next I was instructed to go to the bank and withdraw the rest of the deposit, the bank would not release any more funds. I called okay relax inc. and reported my bank decided not to release any more funds that day. I reported this, and was told to fine another branch! This was it. Something was wrong, and I knew it that moment I got into uber.\nUpon my arrival home I phoned the bank first, and then the police!. It was already too late. I owe the bank the full sum of the bank draft, $8,620.28.",

    "Description": "I was first contacted by text message regarding a job for possible health. They wanted to set up an interview right away through instant messaging on skype or google hangout. At first it seemed very legit they didn&rsquo;t ask for much personal information. Just your name, email, location and phone number. You are then directed to a webpage for possible health which I am sure is probably a legit company that these scammers are using as there cover. They proceeded to give out the pay rate of $38.75 and hour with $16 while doing orientation and a list of jobs like data entry clerk, call center receptionist and payroll clerk. They also included a list of benefits and it seemed way to good to be true. They asked me typical interview questions about my last job, explain why I wanted the job etc.. after finishing all the questions listed they told me to hold for 15-30 mins as they were taking with the board of directors and would let me know if I was hired. (Keep in mind this is all through instant message which I used skype). They said I got hired and asked for basic information, address, phone number, name etc.. nothing again that was super personal that isn&rsquo;t on your resume already. They sent me a welcome email and proceeded to tell me I would be working from home til the new Edmonton office was up and running. They said they would send me a laptop and internet router to work from and all the papers would be mailed to my address. They said they would give me a cheque to pay for all security programs I would need. This all seemed fine since they were not asking for my banking information or SIN number. This is when they told me they would be e-mailing me a cheque which I was to print out right away, I had to make sure to properly cut the paper and use the app on my phone to cash the cheque right away because I would get $50 bonus for completing this right away. I was to sign the back of the paper. I told them I didn&rsquo;t have a printer so they told me I should go right away to a staples or library to complete. I they were very persistent and said things like &lsquo;do you understand?&rsquo; &lsquo;Are you capable of doing this?&rsquo; The were very pushy. I called my bank to ask about the validity of a printed cheque because I didn&rsquo;t want to get in trouble for depositing a faulty cheque. I was told by my banks manager that this was a textbook job scam and the next thing they would do is ask me to send them money. Please do your reasearch and watch out! This is not a legit job.",

    "Description": "I initially applied to a local customer service assistant opportunity in Edmonton, Alberta Canada. I received a response from lkimmel55_bas@indeedemail.com asking me to fill out an online application form at https://fbe.monster/careers/index.php\nI was approved to take part in a two week trial contract to prove my value. Since I was desperate and applying to various multiple jobs, I was not aware that there was a \"switch in job opportunity\". From a local job to an online job opportunity. The opportunity became an online customer service assistant for an web design firm \"in\" New York, NY. Website and address looked legitimate because it the website was beautifully done.\nMy first task was to develop a power point presentation of hotels that will accommodate the company's team of twelve in Montreal. The reason is because FABE LLC is \"expanding and opening new offices in Montreal and Edmonton\" this year. The first task made me commit to this job and I was given the second task of processing a \"financial transaction\". This is were things were getting sketchy and I was desperate and committed to a job that will be ideal for my plans and goals. I was sent an E-transfer of $2,793 CAD from a \"client\" or possibly another victim and was instructed to withdraw it from my personal account to deposit it into a Bitcoin ATM machine. *SCAM ALERT* But I was so determined that this was a \"new process\" for online based businesses. But did not think clearly about, \"Why can't this business do this themselves\". My incentive for doing this was a $113 commission, so I was also blinded by \"instant money\". I completed the transaction despite the bank warning me that I am most likely involved in a scam. Which doesn't help, because anyone can say it can be a scam. However, if they asked me questions about the job to help me realize that it is a scam. That would have been more effective. Tip, \"Do not rush, stay around and make yourself available to a conversation about it being a scam\". Even the convenient store cashier was telling me that it was fraud, after I completed the transaction (converting money to bitcoin and sending it).",

She was very short through email that raised my awareness..\nthe next day, i spoke to the police, went to the bank and they told me to close my account right away. so i did. This is an recurring theme with Bitcoin and companies. getting a third-party to deposit money was a huge red flag. I thought people just invested into Bitcoin because it's successful, I was proven wrong real fast.\nthe bank manager was surprised that they took my debit information such as e - transfers because companies /scammers usually write cheques.

After I completed this I was to buy iTunes cards 500$ worth and take a picture and send them to him.Thats when I stopped replying. Also they wanted me to buy a printer with blank cheques to send to people within their organization because they were from the UK. And it costs to much money to send cheque&rsquo;s by mail. When I do not answer them they demand I do and begin to call me from a states number. I have not answered one call. Also the check was from a Lisa which wasn&rsquo;t a name brought up.",

I emailed them back and asked about a face to face interview and they said I can come to Quebec to have one even though I&rsquo;m in London On, I asked if I could have a face to face interview with the employee here in London I will be working for and they then said &ldquo;You will act as a personal assistant to one of our employees. You will receive all instructions for work from our employee&rdquo; I found this quite suspicious because they wouldn&rsquo;t answer my questions about the interview face to face.

    "Description": "I got an invitation of a work-from-job, which is for data entry/administrative assistant position through a text message. They used the company name \"Naturally Fit\" and want me to interview with a \"hiring manager\" called Gregg Clark using the Google Handout. We using around half an hour to go through the interview, and I got the job offer next day morning. They first send me an job offer letter, which start making things convincing. After that, the \"hiring manager\" told me \"the company\" will send a startup fund using a check though email, with images of front and back side of the check to purchase needed equipment and software, they require me to deposit the check through mobile deposit. As I talk to the man longer and longer, I start feel suspicious because he never get into the detail related to the job; also, when I tried to ask what is the purpose/relationship between what I am doing and the job, he response differently, specifically impatiently and rudely. After I told him I have made the deposit, he required me to send the fund to an \"agent\", but at the same time, my bank account was on hold because of the check verification as the bank representative told. At the meantime, I asked the bank representative to check if the check is counterfeit because I feel suspicious. As a result, the bank representative told me that it is a fake check. Therefore, I recognized I have been a victim of a job scam.",

    "Description": "Can you please look into this I feel like it is a dangerous pyrimid scheme and my parents are wrapped up in it, along with many people all across Canada. I know it is affecting so many vulnerable middle-class people because my parents aren't generally this careless and vulnerable to scams.\nBasically this company called ****** has people who are recruiting other people saying they can \"start their own online business\" but the catch is they need to purchase this ****** water machine (which my parents did) which is about $5000-$7000 depending on the model. Once they purchase this machine it then \"allows them\" to start their own \"online marketing business\" of recruiting other people to start their own \"online marketing business\". The confusing part is my parents are not selling this product (or any actual product) to people they are simply recruiting people and pretending like the online marketing business is so successful and that they're making a lot of money at it when they are not. So my parents are paying money (thousands and thousands of dollars by now) to advertise this \"online marketing business\" on ******** to get people recruited. My parents only make money when someone buys the machine for $5000 (I'm pretty sure they only make $100 off of that recruitment) and then those people start their own business of recruiting other people to do the same thing. The problem is my parents have not made any money. They've spent thousands of dollars advertising this on ******** trying to get recruitment's, and however much they paid to buy the machine to begin with (they're likely well over $10,000 into this business with no sign of giving up. There are groups on ******** with other people who are so-called \"successful\" at this but they are clearly doing what my parents were taught to do via the company instructors which is \"act and look like your making tons of money and have freedom to work when you want and where ever you want\". They are taught by the people higher up in the business to \"act successful\" and \"pretend like they're making lots of money\" to make it look appealing to other potential recruitment (or victims as I feel they may be). There is a complex pyramid of commissions they make per recruitment and once they reach a certain number of recruitment's they go up in the tier and then make a slightly higher commission on the other people's recruitment's below them. They are taught to comment on other recruiter's \"business\" ******** pages &amp; ads to say how this business is working for them and they no longer have to work and they have this crazy lifestyle etc when none of that is true.\nI would like to note that my parents are not intentionally scamming people, they are victim of the scam. I do not intend on getting them in trouble but I want to look out for their well-being. I am shocked that they were actually naive enough to get involved in this to begin with. They believe this is a legit business they are in no way trying to hurt other people by doing this as they are victims of the false promise to make lots of money by recruiting people.\nThis is the ****** page that sells the ****** water filter systems (which I have no idea what it has to do with them getting people to \"start an online marketing business\" other than I feel like its a cover up to make the business seem legitimate). They also don't seem to mention ANYTHING regarding the online marketing business on the ****** website nor do they mention anything about the Water Filtration system when people are talking about the Online Marketing Business but once they hook you into their online seminar they tell you that it is required for you to buy this water system in order to start your online marketing business.\n*********************** **** ** ** ******* ******* ********* ********* ***** ************************************************************ **** ** ***** ********** *************************************************** **** ** **** ***** ******** *** *** ******** *********** ******************************************* ************************************************************************************************** ********************************************************************************************************&nbsp;My understanding is that these people are recruiting people by selling the idea of making lots of money and so much freedom. The recruitment people watch a seminar and are instructed to pay $99 to start the business and then they are told they must buy this water filtration system in order to start being eligible to start their online marketing business. Then once they've bought that then they start the recruitment process over again looking for other recruitment's.\nI recommend investigating and getting an officer to follow the procedure as if they were interested int his business to find out how it actually works.",

Agreement and other payroll process looks reasonable to me so I sent my personal details (state ID, bank details, passport, photo) and signed the contract as well. later she said am in trail period and I have to complete few tasks then they will hire me (after signing employment agreement they told me this) . First task: I have to send 20 dollar worth of bitcoin to a URL which she sent. she asked me to do during weekday but I said am working in another company so I cant but insisted me to do after 7. then I asked her whether I can do on weekend, she asked me to do asap. Saturday first half I have to complete this then Sunday she will give main task to me. But she didn't responded to me after I completed my first task. Monday only contacted me that she will give next task next Saturday Sunday.

    "Description": "Was contacted by a Sr. Human Resources Manager at Aramark Canada Ltd. through indeed.com offering me a job for Customer Service Associate (CSA) position in which i would be working from home.\nSo the first thing that was asked of me,was to fill out an Application for employment in which i filled out.\nThe second thing i was asked to do was to fill out an Employment agreement.\nThen i was contacted and told my application was under review and i would be contacted in 1-2 business days.\nAfter 2 business days i was contacted and informed that i was hired for the Customer Service Associate (CSA) position but i need to fill out a Online Interac E&ndash;Transfer details.(Because i would be working with bitcoin and buying software for customers,so this company would be depositing money into my bank account)\nSo after all forms were filled out,i begin my first day of training.I was told to wait with my email account open because i was going to get sent my first task.\nFinally after waiting a half hour,i was told to create a Skype account in which this Sr. Human Resources Manager told me that she can recieve my messages faster.(Already had a skype account so it was just easy to add them)\nThen i was given another set of instructions below:\n\"The essence of the first tasks is that our finance department will send corporate money to your bank account through e-Transfer Interac.\nThen you need cash out money in the bank branch after that replenish your personal Bitcoin wallet in Bitcoin ATM.\nThe money comes from our customers who are ready to buy our software.

    "Description": "I was in the process of job searching and had sent out quite a few resumes.   One day I received an email from a \"prospective employer\" by the name of Mia Castro from Experrior.com.  Initially, it seemed legitimate and then things started to get strange.\nThey asked some questions based on my experience which I answered.  I got a call from Mia from the number listed on the website which is +1(587)404-0441.  I tried to call it back and it would immediately hang up without ringing.  I tried from my friends phone, same thing.  At first I didn't think too much of it as it could just be technical difficulties, but when I tried again a few days later and it still was happening, I questioned Mia why I couldn't get through. She said it was really busy and the switchboard must be overwhelmed.  That didn't sound right either.\nSo I questioned her again and said that it was not professional to have a number that a customer couldn't get through for such an extended period of time.  She still tried to rationalize it and said that I didn't need to contact anyone at that number as I already was communicating with her \"my manager\" via ********.  I asked to speak to another manager - she told me I didn't need to speak to one, that she was the only one.\nIt became self-evident that this was not a real company.  I just don't want anyone to make this mistake or think that they are a real company.  I tracked the corporation identity to a humble home address in Calgary.  The address listed on their website exists, but the suite number does NOT exist!",

They were willing to utilize this payment process through the organization or through me as an individual.

Worse off he keeps posting the same link to my feed so others have the potential to fall for the scam. Worse off my wife&rsquo;s phone is getting my contacts added to her whattsapp number. It seems like everything is getting compromised. I have spent hours of my time trying to fix the issue by going back and forth to the security team and they do not help I am still locked out. I have attached a screen shot of the scam for your reference. My issue will be resolved if I can stop the spreading of the scam and then close my Facebook account so I can&rsquo;t start over. This is my old profile www.facebook.com/shehzadm. I am extremely frightened to the point where I have to Reformat my main desktop computer. My wife&rsquo;s credit card was charged $600 is for a wish purchase which she doesn&rsquo;t even use. My wife&rsquo;s and her fathers scene point were emptied out so she is disputing that.

While this was all going on, I tried searching to see if they were legit and on the surface it seemed so. Finally they wanted banking info so they could process transactions during the probationary time. This I had a hard time with because so many of the larger companies can do deposit only accounts. When I questioned them on this, they kept saying that it was just for the probationary period. With this I stopped communicating and they kept asking when the form would be filled out. I then tried to find the Canadian Head office of this company and I couldn't find them. I then phoned a business at the address that they gave and the kind person that answered the phone couldn't say if they were an actual business.

    "Description": "Beware!! 110%SCAM. I'm college educated, I pride myself on my integrity and knowledge, and I even got scammed. This was ELABORATE!! They contact you as per your resume that they found on LinkedIn and Ziprecruiter. Even when I was skeptical, they had all the answers. I conversed with them by phone and email 22 times over a 6 day period before accepting the position. When you research the company, it shows in business since 1969. They had the government documents proving they paid taxes  they have a website, there are no spelling errors when email correspondence was sent back n' forth, and they had permanent HQ address. I had to complete testing before hiring, I had an initial phone interview where you could hear people working in the background followed by an in person interview, they answered all my questions, and I even had tax forms, a contract, and direct deposit. Like the checks scam, this one operates through etransfers, wire transfers, paypal, and credit card. I was hired as a payment manager responsible for invoicing the customer, collecting, taking payments, and accounting procedures in regards to logistics. In the past, I have done all these tasks as well, I have a background in management, logistics, administration, and accounting, so the specified duties raised no flags. Then they sent me their customers first payment...then I began to worry. 1) You are obviously expected to use your own bank account? 2) Payment was sent via etransfer to me directly 3) I was sent on a bank run to cash this payment and then redirected to, get this...a convenience store lol I was told to insert the cash into this machine which is used to complete transfers to the business account. This machine was a bitcoin machine. I've heard a lot about bitcoin and got very insecure...I immediately contacted my bank in which they pointed out the funds transfer was fraudulent and to contact the police. I did everything by the book, contacted who I had to, I have all my email correspondence, pictures, as well the receipts. Hours after this happened the \"So called\" company sent another payment. I deleted my communication app (telegram messenger), and ignored all phone calls. This morning, I received an email that mia castro was undeliverable, meaning they ALREADY deleted all the accounts, the website is gone, the phone number is inactive, and they are a ghost. In calling the police, I thought they would take this threat seriously especially because I had every bit of evidence, they said they would send a car, I've called twice, am still waiting. Granted this is no murder, but they have ALL my personal information, and have disappeared after STEALING from whoever's money I transfered. Believe me, they dont care about catching these people, but with the scams becoming more and more sophisticated, and your resumes online, and with the continuous technological advancements in the world today, you are more likely to become a victim, it's clearly not hard. Be proactive, if it's too good to be true...IT IS!! Mine wasn't even too good to be true, including my wage, it seemed very realistic up until the point of no return. Protect yourselves, report to BBB to help others, and just be cautious, cause they are out there among you and I daily.",

    "Description": "I was going through some rough times and looking hard for a job. I had posted my resume everywhere I could in hopes of getting contacted about a better job opportunity than the one I was currently employed at. They took advantage of my desperation for a better job and told me \"congratulations, your resume has been selected, please install Google Hangouts and we will proceed with your interview\" It came out that they were trying to get a company base established in Winnipeg but to get started they were going to send me a cheque to purchase the office materials I would need in order to start working for them. I was in a bad place mentally so I did as they asked and deposited a cashier's cheque worth $5600 USD into my bank account and then sent them a copy of the deposit receipt as they had requested. They proceeded to tell me that they would only give me 1 direction at a time. As a current manager I understood this as if you start giving out too many directions at once, it can be confusing. They then asked me when the cheque cleared to pull the money out and deposit into the bank account of the \"vendor\" At the time this did sound fishy but since they sent me a cashier's check I didn't think it would matter much because in my experience, I assumed a cashier's cheque is like a money order meaning the money is there already. After pulling out the money and depositing it, that's where the issue started. I was told that they didn't give me enough money for the purchase and said they would be sending me another cheque. I received it a couple of days later and this time it was for $8900 USD. I didn't hear anything from my bank for the first one so I went and deposited this one too and sent them a copy of the deposit receipt once again. After a couple of days and trying to login into my online banking and being denied, I decided to call my bank head office. They informed me I would have to go into a bank branch to discuss it with the employees there. I went down to the bank and have never been more mortified in my entire life. When I started inquiring with my bank about what had transpired, they told me that the cashier's check bounced ($5600 USD) and that the second one deposited ($8900 USD) was not signed by the right person and was unauthorized ergo not going through. I asked what else we can do and now my bank is pursuing me for the $6900 I now owe them. I stayed in touch with the original person I spoke with and started asking questions. (fake company rep) I explained to them what happened with both the cheques and they denied it for the first 5 times I messaged them and then they agreed with me that they sent me fraudulent cheques and they wanted to remedy it because they really wanted me to work for them. They had told me originally that the money was sent to purchase a macbook air and all the software programs I would need. They informed me they had the laptop ready for me and sent me pictures of it. (after googling \"macbook air box opening\") I discovered pictures of \"my laptop\" posted on Google with the same couch, coffee table and desktop background on it. They told me to reach out to \"the vendor\" to ask them to give my money back to me as it is that person's fault and not mine. The \"vendor\" had called me at my work (I have no idea where they even got the phone number from) and said that I screwed him over and his bank closed his account because of the fraudulent activity. After contacting them repeatedly and telling them that I cannot afford their screwing with me and costing me this money that they need to remedy the situation. They sent me another cheque for $13,000 USD which I haven't deposited and I am now dealing with the police.",

So I signed the contract and I wasn&rsquo;t asked for any personal information, just to receive payments I order to purchase this equipment.\nI was sent around 900 dollars and the check went through, no issues. Until he started sending me checks in 100 dollar amounts, individually. Weird. I deposited a few and three came back bad. I told him, he sent me three more and they worked. I did t buy anything with them yet. I waited a few days and it cleared so I got these Flexepin vouchers? I hadn&rsquo;t heard of them so he explained briefly and sent me links to learn about how this is a payment method some companies use. I figured okay then. I bought a few of these vouchers and sent the company selling me the equipment, and he emailed me back saying the payment was received and I&rsquo;ll get a tracking number for this phone, laptop, headset??\nI live in Canada and working from home is new to me so I was like, okay.\nIt&rsquo;s been about five days and he sent me over 2,000 dollars in checks that are just sitting in my office untouched because this is weird.

Once I sent my personal information and license, they sent me on little tasks and asked me to do transactions with a bitcoin atm machine on my OWN PERSONAL BANK account. I refused and they said that they would give me a business account once I complete the test and not to worry it is legal. But when I still refused, they said they will give me another task instead where I need to create a profile to recruit other employees as a \"personal assistant\". Again, more personal information for a job that is not clear. What's stranger is that the \"manager\" in contact was with me through instant messaging only (Telegram) and refused to speak. I called the police for their suspicious acts, and the police said it is definitely a scam and to call transunion, equifax, and my bank to prevent misuse of my identity and to report it to business bureau. Apparently, they were going to send me a fake check for my salary and to transfer money on their behalf. BEWARE!",

The spelling was correct, but the grammar was off; simple things that I assumed to be an honest mistake from an HR manager. That probably should have been my first warning sign. Still, because I justified that I've sent out more resumes than I can remember and that this person may be just working on  her off time, I responded to the email.\nIt was a part time job and they offered one-on-one training. They even went through the trouble of staging a telephone interview with me later.  It seemed legit. They gave me the details about the 'position' as a Travel Manager and sent me some documents regarding the job. I had to admit that it looked fairly legit at first glance. The only issue was that the logo seemed a bit basic. I've signed a few employment agreement sheets(which I later found out was a minimally altered free template you can easily get from the internet. Nice) and later sent the filled out documents to them.\nI've completed a basic test where i had to pick out some tourist sites for my town. I live in the middle of nowhere, basically. Apart form some golf courses, farmer's markets, stables for horseback riding and some mediocre ski hills, there isn't much to attract tourists here. Still, I completed the test and passed. They apparently selected me out of a crowd of applicants. Second warning sign.\nThe next test for me was the request for my banking information, even though I'm currently only in the training phase. Outside of some text basically stroking my ego a bit and telling me how I came out on top over a wave of other applicants, they gave me this  request verbatim:\n&gt;\nThird warning sign. That is when I became very suspicious. I looked up similar scams on the internet and they sound very close to this offer. By this time, I flatly  refused and reported them here. They took a lot of care to look legit, but",

    "Description": "This so called recruiting agency, connecting mexican employees looking for jobs in Canada and the U.S., promising a legal work permit from the employer.\nFirstable, a prospect employee will have to set an appointment to stop by at an office located in Mexico City, then travel to there, spending your own money for expenses (bus, taxi, food, etc),  after you get there,  they briefly talk about their agency motto \" claiming to be a certified agency to link employees with employers\",  then,  they take blood and urine samples in the same office, later will make you walk to another building within 10 mins, a place where a so called doctor is located, he will make a physical evaluation, and make a payment in cash for $800 pesos, no receipts whatsoever,  then go back to the agency office. A supposed hr interviewer will be verifying your documents to insure that you have legal documents to travel:  Valid mexican passport, IFE(ID), including your parents birth certificates, and your own birth certificate, school acreditation, diplomas. And they even asked for 3 phone numbers to locate you. Then, they tell you that during process, might take a few months, changing subjects or topics when you ask questions, eventhough, they promised to have positions available before setting an appmt with then,  later,  in order to make sure you are using the same cell number, you must download an app from them, so they can submit your lab test results, after you received them,  they will tell you if you might be an apt person, meaning to continue such process, and if you try to reach the office by phone, will never answer. As they have caller id, and you confirmed everything thru the app, and will keep you waiting with false promises.\nThey keep inquiring hundreds of new applicants thru their facebook page, its a total scam, and a very strict way to still confidential information.\nWe as people in need, looking for decent jobs, are so vulnerable with these type of companies. I really wish to put a stop to them.",

    "Description": "I was contacted yesterday (20th August, 2019) by an individual claiming to be Collins Gray via LinkedIn direct messaging offering a job at Nayton Inc. I was unsure about the offer as it was too good to be true ie offering pay of 35USD/hour of work for either PT or FT. I decided to do some digging into the company and the first red flag was the unprofessional website that stood out. Secondly, the physical address doesn't exist on google maps, Collins didn't understand the concept of payroll and last but not least, it is not listed on BBB. I'm unsure of where this was leading to but I'm assuming they would have asked for my SIN number for payroll purposes. Getting paid $35/hour is great but it's too good to be true if I were to work from home. When I stated my concerns to Collins, all he responded with was \"Thanks\". Kindly look into this as this seems like a scheme set up ideally for identity theft.",

I asked to speak on the phone and the employer was dodgy saying they were flying out of town and I could text and email but not phone them. They then sent many more emails that looked real and all of the information was somewhat repetitive. I gave them basic information, such as name and phone number but never anything such as banking info. They then said that I would receive payment for a job I have not done yet and I would have to transfer a portion of that payment to a clients agent. They sent pictures of a check made out to me for the said amount of money, but I did not deposit it and asked for e transfer to be safer.

They told me this was because they just moved to this office. The inter view went well but I found out that it wasn't a customer service position but instead a full commission sales position. The interview asked me to with their regional manager named\" so and so Lyse\" I use the last name because it is important.  I declined as I had another interview that day and this one had already gone past the allotted time. That evening I get an email from an interview scheduled for the next day, this company was called alpha agency. And in the email I noticed that the address for this company was the same as the platinum empire and the person doing my inter was \" so and so Lyse\". And now today I see the exact same job posting word for word for a company called the lyse group. All of these companies are part of altig. From what I can tell it is a MLM that focuses on door to door sales, then promoting you and you have to open a new branch and hire people under you and make commission off them and so on and so on.",

    "D": "7787.2300",
    "Description": "On July 23/19 I was contacted by a man who called himself David, who represents a company called Crown Carlton Concierge (CCC).  He said my resume came across his desk for a customer service/personal assistant role.  He briefly explained that the role involved taking care of errands for executives and the wealthy such as picking up groceries, prescriptions, dry cleaning, paying bills and other such tasks.  I would be paid $200-$400 per assignment and could do up to eight assignments per week.  He further explained that if I were to successfully complete a three-day probationary period that I would be given an employee account and login to pick from a list of available tasks weekly, making my own schedule.  He explained that gas and other expenses would be paid for by the company and when I was officially hired, I would be paid by direct deposit.  He then asked if that would interest me, and I said yes.\nHe told me I would receive direction from, communicate with and send photos of records to HR using WhatsApp.  He explained I would be getting more direction in a package he would be sending me on Thursday, July 26/19.  He welcomed me to the team, said it was good to have me on board, he looked forward to working with me and we briefly discussed dress attire.  The call ended there.\nOn Thursday, July 26/19 I received a Purolator package that contained; A draft/draft customer copy from the National Bank of Canada in the amount of $7,787.23. A notice on CCC letter head with directions on how to confirm receipt of the draft, signed by Rachel Burk, Financial Co-ordinator for CCC.  The letter request that I call David Bradley to confirm receipt of the funds, warning a stop payment would be placed if I failed to contact him.  I called him and confirmed receipt.  He said I would be doing two assignments and would be paid a total of $400 for these assignments. He instructed me to go to the bank and to call him when I arrived for more direction.  I proceeded to the bank, called him on arrival and he then told me that the bank should not hold the draft as it was verified funds.  He advised that if any questions were asked to say it was for a personal settlement.  I was then instructed to withdraw $4750 and call him back after.\nI proceeded into my bank and spoke to a teller to deposit the draft.  She suggested that because I had enough money in my account for the withdrawal that I could deposit it without verification.  I insisted she call to verify as I was not interested in spending my own money.  She called the bank with me present and verified the draft.  After it was verified, I asked to withdraw $4750. I then called David as previously instructed, he advised that I would be contacted by Lisa in HR and I would be paying some bills.  He also asked to be called again when I arrived at the second location.  Lisa messaged me on WhatsApp.  She sent me a QR code to use for the bill payment and that David would walk me through it.  I called David when I arrived and he again told me I would be taking care of a bill payment, asked if I was familiar with Bitcoin and I said yes.  I then asked what kind of bills are being paid through Bitcoin?  He said that the client settles his donations in this way for non-profit organizations.  It was at this time I began to feel uncomfortable and suspicious but excused it, thinking my other assignments would legitimize the job.\nI proceeded with the process of purchasing and sending the Bitcoin using the QR code sent to me by Lisa and confirmed the completion of the task with a picture of the receipt to Lisa and another call to David, as requested.  I was then told by David I would receive more instructions from Lisa to purchase baby items.  Using WhatsApp, I was sent some pictures and a list of the items that I was to purchase, with amounts &ndash; to be donated to the Children&rsquo;s hospital.  I asked for direction on where to drop it/in who&rsquo;s name/to whom and was advised to donate it to the information desk in the name of that on the draft.   I then purchased the items, or the closest to what I was asked to buy by Lisa and proceeded to the hospital. I had received a message from Lisa advising of my next bill payment of $2080 and that she would be sending the next QR code. A lady named Sheri, representing another role in the company answered when I called David to confirm my arrival at the hospital. She sounded very professional and this rested some of my suspicions.  I confirmed that I was to donate this stuff from Jason (name on draft) and that the hospital would advise me on the process.  I proceeded to donate to the hospital and was asked to complete paperwork.  When I messaged Lisa for the info to complete the form she changed her advice and told me to just donate in my name.  I again started feeling suspicious but did as she directed.\nUpon returning to my vehicle I called David to discuss my concerns with the next assignment.  I explained to him that this draw would put me over my daily limit and I would need to talk to another teller.  I expressed to him that it was weird and he said he would call me back.  Sheri called me back from David&rsquo;s number and explained that she understands my concern but that this was the process, each assignment required a separate draw to avoid confusion.  She added that these are verified funds for a vehicle purchase and that I should not have to explain that to the bank but could if need be.  She directed I withdraw $2850.\nI proceeded to the bank and withdrew the $2850 as directed.  This was a bit of a process as the teller assisted me to arrange my account in order to withdraw the amount around my daily limit.  I proceeded to purchase and send $2080 of Bitcoin as per Lisa&rsquo;s previous message using the QR code she provided.  I then called David to confirm the assignment was complete and sent a picture of the receipt to Lisa as directed.  I was asked if I was available for more assignments the next day and I said yes.  After all these tasks were done, I was left with $825 and now on the hook for the full amount of the draft. It turns out that the draft was a counterfit and the phone number on the draft was changed to the scammer's number. When the teller called to verify the draft, they were actually speaking to the scammers. 4 days later I was notified by the bank (actuall days drafts take to verify funds) that the draft was a fake.",

    "Description": "First I was desperate for a job so was enticed by a Nichole Fox, who contacted me via email with a job offer. She did not say where she got may name and information from, but I had put my resume and contact infor. on indeed and maybe linkled so thought it may have come from the one of the many jobs that I applied for. She  thought I might want to consider a job for an unnamed but great company, with full benefits a full time salary of 32.80 an hour and she named the position as paymaster manager. It was homebased so I could do all of it at home and it was entry level so they would train me. A sucker is born everyday so I did my due diligence to find out about the company, which had a nice website which was very reassuring. But I did not call their number, to verify their employees until later and the number was simply busy. In the meantime Nichole was very pushy about my signing preliminary papers. An application form which unfortunately I had to give my references, I gave out names and contact infor. to  professors from my school who I will now have to warn  as I unwittingly gave them the information they might use nefariously. What concerned me was that they were anxious to get my bank information and said that while on probation I would use my account to send them money from the companies that would send me their payments. And they would give me 3% for each transaction but reserved the right to reverse any money that may be overpaid. This did not sound right even for someone who knows little about how to cheat in the banking system. Also the phone interview which they were so anxious I receive was not at all like the pressure ones that I had encountered before. In fact, I could have said anything and it was okay. Oh, the woman interviewing me over the phone was filipino, while this was not a problem, she seemed more like a  telephone solicitor rather than a member of the company. Nothing seemed professional, even Nichole's correspondance was filled with typos. Also, everything is time sensitive and they are always making sure that you are still in there. But now I am going to procrastinate, perhaps I will play with her, giving her false information until we can catch her.",

    "Description": "This company contacted me via email, said they saw my resume online and that they thought I would be a good fit for a position in their company. They asked if I was interested, and with being in search of work I said Yes. They told me I would have to pass a phone interview (with someone who had a very strong French accent) which was basically someone asking me if I could work full or part time, if I had a car, and letting me know that I would not have access to the company bank accounts until after my probationary period. The job was for the position of 'Operations Manager - Inbound Operations'. They later went on to inform me that I was a good fit and that they thought I would make a great addition to their team. With that they sent me a letter of employment to sign and an official job application form to fill out (for their records). I noticed that I wasn't getting any government forms to fill out for tax purposes, they told me those types of forms get completed after I 'pass my probationary' period! It was after that when they started to inquire about my personal information, stuff that isn't normally required when being hired. They wanted to know about my banking knowledge, what kind of bank account I had (personal, business or both), if I was familiar with different types of wire transfers and if I had experience with credit cards (they wanted to know if I had credit cards available). When this information came about obviously some red flags went up... they were wanting me to start giving them some of my personal information so that they could either access or have me access this information in order to complete the work I would be doing for them (ie. they were wanting me to use my own for for the purposes of their business). I explained to them that I would not be using my own personal finances in any way and that this seemed like a scam. They went on to say that if I wasn't comfortable with doing that there were other ways for me to 'pass my probationary' period without having to use my own money. Next, they contacted me and said they had a client and that I was to go onto https://www.goldmoney.com/ and set up an account and once I had that completed I was to contact them. During setting up the account I asked them for the company address (I hadn't realized it yet, but I had no record of their address except that they were located in Mississauga ON). They wouldn't give me their company address, they told me to use my own or a previous company I worked for as it would make the process of setting up the account happen today (rather than in 10 tens time if I used their business). So I did them one better, I had looked them up on the BBB and found their address. I also found a different phone number than what was on their website... by the way, the phone number on the website went straight to voicemail and said 'leave a message' to which no one ever called me back, and I left 4 messages (that was it), and the phone number on the BBB went nowhere, it was a number that didn't ring. Anyhow, once I finished setting up my account with Goldmoney, I let them know and they in turn asked me to give them my account sign-in information along with my passwords. They were going to give the 'client' this information, let them do business using the account and I would get 5%. Once again I told them that this is unacceptable and this time I told them that I think they are running a scam. They told me that if I didn't give them this information I would not 'pass my probationary' status and that I would not be employed by them (and try to remember, they already employed me and had me sign an employment agreement)! I told them they weren't getting squat from me and that I was going to report them, they immediately deleted any conversations they could to try and hide anything that was discussed (the had me use the 'Telegram' app, they said it was the quickest and easiest way for communication). I contacted Goldmoney to have my account deleted and let them know that I thought they were being used as a medium to a scam. Attached are copies of the files they sent me to read or complete, as you can see any one could go online and design these from scratch. One last thing, in the subject heading for every email it read 'Dear My Name', even when I changed the subject heading it would come back as 'Dear My Name' again... I said it was unprofessional and made me feel uncomfortable, they couldn't understand why.",

The company is listed as a corporation on the government of Canada website but the offer is way too good to be true. They have a website but it really doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, poor grammar, random services and products offered, and after looking up the domain name, the website was created in May of this year and they claim to have been around since 2001.

    "Description": "I was contacted with a job offer paying $670/week for part time employment by someone using the name Julia Grosso. Interview was conducted mostly through IM via Telegram, then I was called by someone with a thick foreign accent to finish the interview, it was very quick and I got the job right away. I was told I needed to activate my bitcoin wallet and spend $10 on bitcoin before they would send me the money for the bitcoin for my first task with a customer. the QR code she had sent me did not work on the BTM so I was instructed to make an another wallet through Blockchain. Proper grammar was almost never used on Telegram. If you go to the website Suntextech.com it says they are based in North York, Ontario however if you go to the attached facebook page at the bottom of the website it leads to something called Multitech Support and Development based in Nepal. Their website looks almost exactly the same as the Suntex website. She had send me a Labor Agreement and everything seemed so legitimate, I was completely fooled.",

    "Description": "These people try to \"recruit\" people to be quality assurance specialist, where you need to evaluate companies or businesses to see if they are adhering to rules and regulations (a bit like mystery shopper). They will tell you that you are going to be paid about 300$ per evaluation and that the maximum of evaluation you can carry per week is 3 and minimum is 1. They ask you how much you are willing to do, and once you've told them they ask for you name, address and phone number saying they have to carry out a sort of security check and that you will hear from them 24 hours later. When you do hear from them they send you a tracking number and tell you they have sent you an evaluation package with all the instructions. When you receive the package, it involves 3 pages including the instructions and a cheque of more about 2000-3000$. In the instructions they first tell you to deposit the cheque in your bank account, take out money in cash, evaluate a business/company and then deposit the cash in an account in another bank. They also tell you to do it on the same day/right away. I personally received a BMO cheque of 3900$ with the same instructions and was told to evaluate a walmart. It is just a way of scamming people's money and getting the money. The best thing you need to do is go to the bank where the cheque was issued and report it to them, but DO NOT deposit or take out any money using the cheque.",

After approval for connection received a message to drop CV to the Flag Oils website career section. The next day receive call from Nathan +16474920667 saying that CV has been reviewed and to reply the online interview(typical HR interview questions) to career@flagoils.com. The next day i receive and contract agreement with Flag Oils letter head mentioned salary package of 9970CAD with accommodation and family status. Few days later received message from Nathan Felix saying another interview will be conducted by Technical team. On the same day receive call from +15879790717 Amanda Vice President H and Chief Information Officer (https://flagoils.com/our-team/) introduce herself as secretary of Nathan Felix and start asking few non technical questions and immediately mentioned that i had passed the interview and company will hire me, so wait for an official email from HR  career@flagoils.com for appointment letter and instruction  to apply visa and work permit. Both in contract and appointment letter position offered was not disclosed. In that email the company provided email and phone number of a person working as Appointed Immigration Attorney Mr. Frank Lee (+91- 837-500-7296 /  info@canadian-em-ca.com). Requested to contact the Immigration Attorney Mr.Frank (Canadian Embassy in New Dehli) immediately to expedite the visa and work permit process. After phone conversation with Mr. Frank he sent an email requesting for passport, national ID, education certificate and family travelling documents. After completely submit all the document after two days received an email from Mr.Frank saying that  visa file Application has been approved by General consular (Michael H Corbin) this morning to initiate file processing (certifacate of approval with signature of Consular Officer attached both for me and my wife name, required to make payment of USD 600 to ensure the visa approved immediately. He requested to send money to TIBOU  YAO (Secretary in Canadian embassy in New Dehli)  thru money gram. When i asked him why i need to apply thru Canadian Embassy in India and need to send money thru money gram he told me that is the easiest way to get visa application approved quickly. Mean while Mr. Nathan insisting me to follow whatever instruction given by Mr. Frank to make sure the visa application to be done quickly. The next day Mr. Frank sent another email saying that his secretary is day off money to be send to Napoleon Gideon Shoo. After that email i refused to answer call from Mr. Frank and he didn't call me back too. Mr. Felix was trying to convince me by messaging to me and Ms. Amanda called me asking why the money transfer not been made. I told her that i am not convinced to pay thru money gram and i will only pay to official canadian embassy website. She told that in that case the contract will be terminated and i will be not coming to Canada. At the beginning i was so convinced this was for real because of the website (flagoils.com). it looks so real and very professional. All the web sections are with full information and high level management biodata including Mr. Nathan Felix (Chief Human Resources Officer) and Amanda Horlonzo. I believe this is only a virtual company operating to do job scams. Further checking the bio data of both Nathan and Amand in the company website and LinkedIn profile is not tally. I really appreciate if the authorities can check this company profile and stop this activity before it ruin someones life. I have notify few of the people that contacted by these scammers thru LinkedIn to avoid such scams and this group are still active baiting oil and gas employees around the world mostly asian countries. Just to inform all the phone calls i received from Flag Oils in Alberta code are during Malaysian (Asian time) not during the canadian working hours.",

    "Description": "I am a contractor and I was contacted a couple days ago via text message by someone called Charlie asking if I do decks and patio construction. After a brief conversation I agreed to have a look at the address he provided and he said he would give me a deposit to secure a place in my schedule. All of this was fine until he asked for my banking info so he could give me a mobile deposit. I had not heard of this type of payment and told him I would not give him my banking info. I gave him the option of email money transfer or send an actual cheque in the mail. He refused and told me to trust him and he would do mobile deposit. I blocked his number as I had a bad feeling about him. Today I was sent a text from a different number saying his name was Charkie and asking if I do deck and patio construction. I googled the phone numbers and discovered one is from Boston and one from Illinois. Seems to coincidental to not be the same guy. I'm convinced it's a scam.",

When they first emailed me, the did not include any information about the company, I had to ask them for it. Because I was desperate for a job at the time and I had never been approached by a scammer before, I was unaware of their tricks and I let it slide. I got suspicious when I couldn't find information about the company online, the only information I could find was that the company was dissolved in 2017 on the Service Canada website. When I asked the manager, she responded saying the company has currently resumed its operations and they are working on fixing the Issue; however, the service Canada page requires that active corporations update the page 15 days after any changes. That's when I realized the website they sent me was sketchy, the address they use is actually owned by a law firm but was owned by Holcim prior to its termination. Furthermore, I realized our communication was constantly weird and unprofessional, such as emailing me on the weekend to ask how I am doing and nothing about the job. It took me time to realize this but I am now more aware and I will do more research whenever I get a job offer.",

    "Description": "I am quite positive this is a scam. I could not find much information about the company online (except for their company website), but I found a reddit post by a user describing a similar job offer, which commenters were identifying as a scam. I'm not sure if the company offering the job mentioned in the reddit post is the same company as the one that offered me a job.\nI was first in contact with the company by email. I had applied to a job (\"client services assistant\" at VTR Technical) on Indeed, and a couple days later (on May 8th) I got an email from them thanking me for my interest in the position and to send them my name, email address, and phone number, which I did.\nA number of days later (on May 21st), I received an email stating that this client services assistant position has already been filled, but there is another position available, cashier, that they would like to offer me. (I initially found this email strange because the name of the company on the Indeed job posting, VTR Technical, was different than the company name, Hellanback Solutions Inc., on this email.The first email was from a \"Luisa James\" at VTR Technical, and the second email was from a \"Jessica Wilson\" at Hellanback Solutions Inc.) The email contained a link to the company website that described the cashier position. Honestly, I skimmed the page, wasn't really paying attention to what I was reading, and clicked the link at the bottom of the page to continue with the job application. This page asked for me to enter my email, first and last name, phone number, city, postal code, and hours of availability, which I did.\nA couple days later (on May 24th), I received another email (this time from a \"Samantha Bishop\" at Hellanback Solutions Inc.) telling me that they are offering me a \"probationary period with an opportunity for permanent employment\" in the cashier position. All that I need to do is confirm that I have a smartphone with a camera to continue with the employment process.\nAlmost everything about this company and job offer seem like a scam to me. Basically no qualifications are needed for this position, I have only been in contact with them over email, the company emailing me is different than the one I originally applied for (I could also not really find anything about the other company, VTR Technical, online), and every email I've received has been from a different person. Also, the \"cashier\" position itself is the biggest red flag. For whatever reason, I hadn't really paid much attention to the cashier job description at first, but after the last email I received I went back and reread it, and it sounds super sketchy: Job duties: \"receiving payments, withdrawing cash from the bank account, exchanging cash using crypto currency ATMs, improvement of the invoices processing efficiency, and performing reports.\"\nI haven't performed any of these job duties, since I am not accepting the job offer and will not be emailing them back, so I haven't actually been scammed yet. But everything about the interactions I have had with this company, the company website, and the cashier position description have led me to believe that this employment offer is a scam and this company will try to scam me if I accept this job.\nHopefully I described this encounter in enough detail. I have attached screenshots of the emails I received. The website listing information on the cashier position is hellanback.io/cashier. I am happy to provide any other information needed.",

I should have been more intelligent and not continued forward with it when they demanded a cash deposit to a bank account. When i deposited the money, they told me to tell my bank, if they asked, to tell them this guy was a cabinet maker? After they sent me that email, i immediately called the bank to reverse the transfer but it was too late, they had already processed the payment. this tech company emailed me back and demanded the rest of the payment in bitcoin or electronic currency.

    "Description": "I was looking for employment back in January, so I had profiles on LinkedIn and Indeed with my email address. A few legitimate businesses contacted me for interviews, so I wasn't suspicious.\nA woman named Evelyn Leet contacted me on January 8 with a company called Alliance Logistics (Alliance-Log). She said they had a work-from-home position as a \"Payment Manager.\" When I searched their company name and a few different ones came up (some seemed legitimate) but nothing seemed to connect to them and the website from their email looked very vague and sketchy. But they offered me a phone interview and the money was great, so I decided to give them a chance.\nI took the morning off work for this interview, thinking it would be a normal 30 minute to 1 hour initial phone interview. Instead, a woman who could barely speak English with a heavy French accent started to explain that I was hired, the training process would be three weeks, and when could I start. I tried to ask normal interview questions, but she got irritated and kept repeating herself, just asking me when I could start. And that \"It will all be explained when you start.\" Even when I asked what my duties were, they were vague, just about processing money through accounts. Her accent was so heavy that I had to keep asking her to repeat herself. I wasted my morning for this two minute interview.\nWhen I got off the phone, I sent an email to Evelyn Leet with all the questions I would expect. I heard nothing back until today.\nToday, I was contacted again by this Evelyn Leet email address for a \"Payment Manager\" position. As if they forgot they emailed me or interviewed me at all, as if nothing happened.",

I went to the website and a direct message popped up from Adam asking me how he could help. I asked are you a bot or a person and no response. Then a couple weeks later I went back and said Hello. I am ready for help. A woman's picture popped up and said hello. I said I was wondering more about your program. I can't find it in the BBB, can you prove you are legit? Sorry, there are just so many things to be careful for nowadays. Then I waited and said bye. There is nothing on YouTube. There are no reviews I can find anywhere except on their website and they always have a \"limited sale\" on their iTESOL course. As soon as I sent the message asking if they are legit the site turned to not secure. There is a video on the site with a woman named Melissa (Atanasi?) and it could have been stolen from anywhere. She makes no claim as to learning from iTESOL or getting a job from them. They also promise you will get a job or your money back. Adam Morehouse is the founder but Adam Mcilroy is the one that has their name on the video.

    "Description": "These people contacted me through Indeed.ca . They offered me a position of payment manager, as a remote position. I checked for any red flags online, there were none. They were even registered on the Canadian federal websites for 3 years.\nThey asked for the completed application and one piece of ID, which I sent them thinking they were legit. We had a phone interview too. I blacked out my DL number and Birthday(I missed once spot where it was a second time, and so I had to go to my bank, and close my account).\nThey then sent me an application info email, followed by two questionnaires, all of it seemed legit.\nAfter that, this lady, Tiana Newman, pretending to be the HR for this fake company, asks me if I'm ready for the practical part of the candidate exam. I said yes, expecting that I would be sent excel sheets or information which I would have to analyze or something.\nInstead she said, that she would send me money via Interac to my personal bank account which I would have to cash out, convert to Bitcoin and hand over to their agent. According to her my \"corporate account was being set up\" but I would have to use my personal account in the meantime. That was a big indication and I became aware of what they actually are.\nI instantly searched for newer types of scams and sure enough i found articles about this exact same method. They transfer money stolen from another account, which would be reverted back to the owner once the bank had processed the fraud charges. This fake company would have gotten away with their Bitcoin currency and the victim would end up double spending.\nThey even set up their fake website which looks legit at a glance, then i noticed the discrepancies like no \"About Us\" section, the board of directors are all customers and they can be anyone. Their services are explained very vaguely and they include stock photos when you try to open the link. Also, the address on their website is just a regular house, not even an office.\nExtremely dangerous scammers, I hope no one falls for this. Luckily, I did not divulge any more information and took the necessary steps to protect myself from any further implications.",

I reached out to him and he asked if I had a gmail account and google hangout. He gave me an email address (cargill.inc0@gmail.com)  and interview code and I was to make contact through google hangout.\nI made contact with Leigh Anne Baker, who stated she was the hiring manager/human resources manager for Cargill Inc. based out of Wayzata, Minnesota. She told me about the company and what the job entailed.\nWe proceeded with the interview and she was impressed. She stated that she had to send our conversation to the head of the HR dept as everything was monitored.\nShe got back to me in about 20 mins to say I had got the job.\nShe asked how I preferred to be paid, weekly or bi-weekly and what form of payment I preferred such as direct deposit, credit card transfer or check.\nThen she stated I needed to provide her with the following;\nMy full name:\nSex:\nDate of birth:\nHouse Address in full:\nPhone numbers:\nEmail:\nMobile Network:\nA Passport photograph to attach to your profile.\nTo enable the secretary enlist them into the Company's Register for proper employee&rsquo;s documentation.\nShe said Iwill be need the following Software Programs and&nbsp; working materials, to enable me to perform this job effectively without any problems; Myob Business Essentials Software 2015, US Patent Single, Users Pack simply accounting 2015, Apple Final Cut Express 3.5 HD Upgrade, Norton Ghost 9.0, Microsoft Office XP 2015 Standard Upgrade, Peach tree Premium Accounting 2015, EDI software program, Apple MacBook Air, Company's Telephone..., And lots more.\nI asked if all of this was going to be provided by the company or if I was responsible to obtain it myself. Her response was:\nThe funds for the softwares and working materials will be provided to you by the company with your choice of receiving payment. You will be using the funds in making purchase of&nbsp; your equipment's from the company&rsquo;s certified Vendor and All equipment's will be labeled on them with the company&rsquo;s name, they will have you connected to the company&rsquo;s database.\nShe says, The funds will be covering up for both your working and training materials as well as setting up a mini office in your home which I believe you do have a space provided for that ?\nYou are supposed to have this purchased from your pocket but the company will provide this via direct deposit due to the costs so you don't have to worry about that.\nShe says I will be making the purchase of the programs as the company is not specialized on the software programs. You are to get it from the company certified vendor that is the third party to the company who will&nbsp; then install with disc and have it shipped to you within 3 working days via FedEx.

    "Description": "The scam began when I received the following email from an individual identifying themselves as a recruitment consultant. Initially this did not appear strange as I'm an electrical engineer who gets contacted by recruiters semi-regularly and the email went to my inbox (not my spam folder).\n\"Greetings,\nTrust you are having a great day. The management of Surrell Engineering is in need of a regional representative and your linkedin profile shows you are capable of handling such opportunity. This offer comes with a lucrative annual salary and other benefits. If interested kindly respond positively for more information about the job.\nBest Regards,\nRecruitment Consultant\nChristian *****\".\nMy gut told me that this was a scam, but initially I assumed that Surrell engineering was in fact a real firm whose name was being used without permission. I attempted to contact the company to inform them of the situation via the general email address listed on their website (info@surrellengineering.com), but my email failed to send. Upon further inspection, I realized that the entire company was a fake. This became certain when I reversed image searched a photograph of a female member of the management team, (a person identified as Ruth ******), and discovered the original image in the donor brochure of a US based Jewish hospital. The person is correctly identified in this booklet and she is not named Ruth ******. Presumably, the photograph was stolen.\nFurthermore, when searching for the image I discovered a link for a second fake company identifying themselves as Swermat Group (http://www.swermat.com/index.html). The entire website was identical to Surrell's - even the logo. The only difference was the name of the firm and the location, as Swermat is reportedly based in Zurich whereas Surrell is reportedly based in Melbourne. It's likely that both websites (and possibly others) are managed by the same individual(s).",

They saw my resume on Indeed.com for a certain job position and this was why they emailed me a job offer. As desperate for a job I was, I responded to the offer and agreed to take it. Sure enough a woman named Sara Hermet (ficticious name) answered my response by emailing me back a description of the job and an attached job application form. I filled in this application form and sent it back through her email address. From here, days have gone and I got no response from her anymore. Then I got suspicious about the company itself so I checked their website. Everything shown on their website are just figures or images of their product's description with no real links and their two phone numbers may not be real business lines. Only then did I know that this whole deal was fake. So far, nothing was lost from me but they sure got the most of my identity. My final thoughts on this company was that it's fake. I'm not sure if they'll do me harm in the future as they have my personal information already or maybe my information would turn up useless to them. I just hope nothing goes bad.  I would definitely like to get this company examined thoroughly so no one else would end up as a victim of fraudulent job offers.",

    "Description": "Brenda Pais from President Youth Program hired me as an administrative assistant. They said they are a new organization assisting foreign exchange students to visit Canada and Winnioeg is their new location and will be putting up an office here in March 2019. I followed up with her as to when the office in Winnipeg will open and said they are still looking for a location and will give me update soon. She gave me 1st task to create a slide about nice sceneries in Winnipeg and submitted to her. Second task was to create a slide again about accomodation options for the exchange students to stay for a week. But before I had finished the 2nd task, she called me and said that there will be set of students that will be coming to Winnipeg the next week and they need to pay the reservation of the hostel via cash and needed my help to pay (transferring the payment to my banking account) to the hostel. I asked why they can't just transfer it directly to the hostel's account and said they (hostel) don't accept e-transfers, and so I agreed. She said they'll e-transfer the money via email and so I gave my email address. She said she will give me a call again to give instructions and so I waited. The next morning she called and then confirmed that the money has been transferred and then gave instruction to withdraw the money and go to a place and once I get there she will callback again to give me another location. This made me question but I withdrew the money and sent her a receipt for confirmation. I asked for the name of the hostel but she didn't respond. This time, it made me starting to worry. Why she can't just directly give me the name of the hostel and exact address and pay it? I did not agree to go to that place. I searched the place but there was no hotel/hostel nearby. I made excuses to not to go to that place because I'm not sure what or who is waiting there for me and also, I'm new to Winnipeg. She said on that place, I can deposit it to a machine. That blown my mind and I asked a lot of questions and then told me she'll call the hostel and will call me back. After minutes, she called me back again and said I can just deposit the money to a bank in any branches. She gave me an account name and account number. This really gave me chills. Brenda said at first they won't accept e-transfers but how come now she instructed me to just deposit it to someone I don't know!! To me, all I think of that day was just to get out of that mess and hell don't want to do that again. She kept calling me and asked if I have already deposited the money and said it needed to be deposited ASAP to confirm the reservation payment. It took me time to deposit the money since it is not right anymore. I wanted to get out of this mess asap! And so I went to this bank and deposited to that account Brenda gave. I sent her the receipt to confirm the deposit and said she'll contact me again and give update. From there, I did not contact her, I was just waiting for her to contact me just to at least give me idea what was that all about. It was all sudden and she even kept me hanging. The day after had passed and still no message from her. I never tried to contact her after that incident.",

    "Description": "The scammer first had a \"recruiter\" reach out to me on LinkedIn, with a complete profile that matched the VIACOM website. He provided me very specific details about the job offer in a very professional manner, stating Viacom was attempting to start a new programme, that aimed at hiring employees through international and online networks, due to the increasing advancements and use of technology and asked for an email to use for the primary contact. I have found employment through recruiters before on Linkedin with very respectable companies so this did not raise any red flags - especially considering they provided me with the website, and all contact details - except for phone contact, but did include a skype account - VIACOMRecruits.  I reviewed a significant amount of information online, which made me reassured with this company as being legitimate, what I did not think of was that current OR past employees, as well as, scammers who have never worked with the company, could possibly steal all this information AND MORE - to legitimize their scam.\nWhitney was the main form of contact through email and asked me almost 20 or more questions over the course of a week to see if I would be a suitable candidate. All questions were normal and professional some which were personal, but would be asked by any employer.., as were the communications generally throughout the week. Whitney also uses a signature and a profile picture all correlated to the website and the company logo and even provided a LEGITIMATE CONTRACT WITH VIACOM HEAD OF OPERATIONS SIGNATURE AND LOGO. Along the way, Whitney asked if I would be available for a Skype interview and, as someone who has done several of these for international companies, no flags were raised. Whitney was also able to answer all my questions regarding the company, hiring standards and policy, which makes me assume the individual is a CURRENT OR FORMER EMPLOYEE. However, when the day came, she was \"experiencing computer issues\" and could only facilitate a Google Hangouts, which started to raise some suspicions, but because of how the course of the whole interaction has gone, I did facilitate this conversation in which she offered the job of being an Online Administrative Assistant for either a full-time or part-time position, and requested I submit the contract by 6 pm UK time to be processed, as well as some ID's to verify my identity. I submitted the contract as well as the form provided by my bank for direct deposit. With this, they have stolen money from me, opened accounts on behalf of myself and more than likely shared information to other parties - I have closed all accounts associated with the contact and have reached out to the city police who informed someone in the government.\nWhitney has either blocked me on all accounts and so has the recruiter, or both have deleted their accounts. I have attempted to contact VIACOM's legitimate business and they have not responded to any forms of communication between their social media accounts, emails and have even reached out to specific offices located in North America and the UK.",

    "Description": "Please read my instructions.\nThis information is useful to you and it is very important for you.\nWhy does our company use Bitcoin to pay for jobs.\nClients of our company are sponsors for training new personnel so that after an internship in our company outstanding specialists in their field would go out.\n1. Zero or very low commission:\nThe commissions are practically independent of the amount transferred or from the location of the sending and receiving parties. Often transactions are free. The commission is required only for the formation of technically large transactions that load the network, or very small amounts, to avoid an attack on the network by spamming a huge number of meaningless transactions.\n2. Instant transfers:\nIn banks, transfers between accounts take on average 3-5 business days, or more, if they are foreign transfers. In crypto currency transactions are instantaneous. However, when working with large amounts, it is recommended to wait for several confirmations by the transaction network, usually it takes less than an hour.\n3. Safety, reliability, security:\nIn crypto-currency to store the access keys to the funds, we use proven cryptography with a division into open and private keys. Similar algorithms are used by banks and other financial organizations to protect their data. And the total processing power of the Bitcoin network, which is used to protect the history of transactions, in 2012 exceeded the computing power of any supercomputer in the world.\nI'll give you one Bitcoin account of our company. And I'll teach you how to use it.\nOf course, you will need some bitcoins.\nWe will provide you with funds for this reason.\nI'll help you buy bitcoins.\nWe need to be able to transfer money to you so that you can buy bitcoin for work.\nPopular methods of bank transfers:\n1. Direct Deposit.\n2. E-Transfer Interac.\nAre you familiar with the transmission of e-transaction?\nAll transactions in our company are made through the bank. This is a confirmation of the reliability of our money. We cooperate exclusively with banks!\nAll transactions are conducted under the supervision of the bank's security service.\nAbout any expenses:\nYou do not need to spend money from your pocket. All fees that you will have you can pay from the amount you receive.\nYour initial capital will be distributed to 2-3 transfers. All information about taxes I will provide you with your salary when you finish the internship.\nThis is your second task in our company.\nAll transactions are protected by our security team.\nOur company works only with reliable customers.\nAll information will not be passed to third parties.\nLet me know if you're ready proceed to the second task.\nIf you are now free and ready to perform the task, I will give you further instructions.\nBest regards,\nAttwood Recruitment Solutions Ltd,\nMegan Dennis\nContacts:\nCompany name: Attwood Recruitment Solutions Ltd.\nWebsite: http://attwoodrs.net/\nTelephone: +1 (902) 704-1715",

We are pleased to extend an offer of employment to you in the position of Administrative Assistant. After previewing your resume on Indeed, our HR department came to a conclusion that you are qualified for it. If you are interested in our job offer, please contact us for more information at job@aenetwork.ca (HR Department) / AE Network.\"\nI did send them an email to say I was interested in applying for the position. I received a response fairly shortly back that advised they were opening a business in my city (no city was actually listed) in April and they were looking for hire people quickly. I was to respond to the email to accept the position. The email did include a list of qualifications, a pdf with a job description, and a link to their website: aenetwork.ca. The grammar in the email was decent but not great, there was no contact name included and when I went to the website, it was down for \"scheduled maintenance\".\nI attempted to google the business as they stated they were branching out from Montreal but there is zero information posted anywhere else about the company online. They have sent me some electronic forms to sign for agreements. I didn't fill any of those out.\nOn their website they said they are partnered with companies such as Air Canada, Destination Canada, and the Aboriginal Tourism Association. I reached out to them and they confirmed they are not partnered with this company. After I checked with them, I did not respond to any more emails with AE Network, so beyond my personal information, I'm not sure what they were after.\nAs I couldn't find any prior history for this company's scam, I just wanted to make sure I reported it so others could find it much easier before they gave them anything.",

    "Description": "We found the ad on Facebook and filled in a webform stating our interest in the auditions.  We were then invited to an audition.  At this 1st meeting, there was a video powerpoint about their company.  We were there, one by one, invited to meet one of their employee for a short interview (approx 5 to 8 mins) and mini auditioning, then right away told that we 'kinda of like your child' and could we meet again the next day for a 2nd auditioning, but that they would confirm the same night if this 2nd meeting still stand.  Later in the day, it was confirmed to come the next day.  At that 2nd supposively auditioning, we were right away told about their fees (even before proceeding to the 2nd auditioning).\nThe 1st meeting made us think that they would do multiple auditioning BEFORE telling us that they would register us.  It was NEVER mentioned about fees in the 1st meeting to make people come back.  This company misleads people to think they will have a chance to show their talent but barely takes time to see if you have talent but quickly asks for deposit without getting to know you.\nThe company claims to be seeking new talent so holds auditions. When you&rsquo;re asked to come back they demand a fee in US currency claiming it&rsquo;s for an opportunity to be in front of talent agents etc but the company itself ARE NOT talent agents. Law stipulates that no agent can receive payment until the talent is compensated by work which is usually a 10% commission.\nI am very disappointed at the way this company proceeds and makes believe the people (especially the children) that they are going to help you with your dream.  It is very sad to take advantage of people like that.  Luckely I got myself informed and DID NOT sign or pay anything, I stopped the process and did not pursue.  I am filling this in, in hope to help others in NOT getting caught with this scam.",

They attached this poorly written PDF file to read over that details the job summary and FAQs. After reading that I got even more suspicious as the grammar/spelling mistakes in there were even worse! It sounded too good to be true as well. $20/hr plus $70 per complete assignment, fulltime, holiday pay, benefits, etc... As if! Then I went to their site and it was even worse... Such a cheap put together site with not many working buttons, links that took you nowhere, and the \"Contact\" Us\" section was extremely vague; with only a small section for you to fill out a form to send them. No actual address, names, numbers or anything.. After Googling Mystery Shopper scams it became abundantly clear to me that this was a scam. I emailed this \"David Patel\" back asking him for more details and suspecting that this may be a scam and he has yet to get back to me... Even though he was so adamant that I became an \"employee\" for them.. Apparently it's common for these people to send fake checks to you, then you cash them, buy gift cards for them.. The check bounces so the bank wants YOUR money and the gift cards you bought for \"work\" are stolen by your \"employer\"... Mr \"David Patel\", lol. Be warned! Please. Don't be easily fooled! Easy things to notice are spelling mistakes, grammar issues, etc. Clearly their first language isn't English and with them trying to tell me they're Canadian is laughable. Even digging more into Google on their so called website I can see that their IP addresses are based out of the US, yet they claim they're Canadian with only one head office in Quebec... As if.",

    "Description": "I applied for several part time jobs online and received an email from unifund group(collection agency), saying that they are interested to offer me a position i just have to choose from 3: manager, assistant controller, finance clerk. all of them have full time and part time options. Salary is pretty good for all of the positions offered. Someone called asking me some question, like a phone interview. Then they sent me some documents to fill out, agreement for training, job description and my deposit pay information. After that one representative contacted me via text msg on telegram saying that its a great career opportunity for me and that im going to be helping with setting up their new office in the area where i live. I also can work part time from home or full time from the office and the main part as per their company secret they accept bitcoin payments from debtors so i will require some kind of training on that. They never answered any of my questions. the only thing they told me that i need to do training and set up my personal account on bitcoin platform so i could start the training. After i asked some questions about their company, and received some generic answers, which seemed  not real. The website looks like the website for another existing collection agency.",

    "Description": "I applied using Indeed.ca and was contacted by the \"Company\" HR department telling me that they were looking over my resume to see if I would be a good fit for the job. I was then contacted by HR again with an employment contract. The contract stated my pay, that I would be working from home, and that I would be creating opportunities for students to travel from all over the world to Canada. I was then told to use Telegram in order to communicate with my \"boss\" Brenda Pais. I received my first assignment which told me to create a presentation about my home town or province and to include activities to take part in. The second assignment had me find hotels that would be in a lower price range for visiting students and finally my last assignment had me find International University Student opportunities. During the two weeks I had worked for the company I was contacted by my employer and told that I needed to make payments to a Hostel in Halifax by using a BitCoin machine. The money was transferred to me then I was asked to put the money in the BitCoin machine and send photos of the receipts. I was asked to do this 5 times in the span of 3 days. During this period I was told to track my hours as they would calculate the hours at the end of a two week period and then I would get paid. I never received any money and a few days before the \"payday\" I was cut off of all communication from my boss and I have not heard anything since. I am not the only one to go through this, I have been in contact with two others who fell for the job opportunity. The contract seemed very real and legitimate and it is a regret taking this job.",

It was a company helping forien exchange students plan and set up trips to Ottawa, and for now before the Ottawa office was opened I would be completing assignments for them like presentations on Ottawa tourists attractions and accommodations. I started with them February 11 and started working on my first assignment, putting in many hours and once my presentation was handed in they praised me for how great it was!... I started working on my second assignment and then they asked if I would go and pay for hotel reservations for a group coming into town shortly, they sent me the money and I paid for what I thought were hotel reservations! Apparently I just laundered money for them! I don&rsquo;t understand how people can live with themselves doing this to other people!!! So now I have no job I thought I did I&rsquo;ve stole money from some poor innocent person, spent 50 hours of my time working on presentations that were fake and I will never be paid for my time or work! ??",

Did a very short phone interview and received a job offer on Friday Feb 1st to start on Monday Feb 4th.

Suspicion aroused but it was a job. For payment information I provided an email and opted for etransfer payments. no bank info was provided.\nOn Tuesday 12th feb, I received an emergency call followed by correspondence saying one of their employees got in a car accident and I was needed to help complete a payment. The lady over the phone said I had to make a payment at a Calgary hotel for a reservation that had not been paid for. $3000 was sent to me via Interac which I deposited into my account. Address I received led me to a bitcoin atm at signal hill. At this point I had no more doubts and was sure it was a scam as there are warnings all over atm machine. (Thanks Calgary Police)\nWent straight back to the bank to report incident deposit funds into my account. I imagine the Interac will be reversed soon.",

Looks like the Honest Review website has been shut down. The 'company' claims to be a mystery shopping business, and they have a great-sounding pay rate, with benefits, etc. They have no address listed in Quebec, and all three versions of the scam that I know of have the same founding woman and founding story on their website. They emailed me directly, stating that they found my resume on a job search site that I do use, and after a very unprofessional phone interview, sent me a contract and tax forms to print, sign, and email back. The cumulative phone and email contact I had was with just a single woman, from what I could tell.",

    "Description": "I first received contact from an email address telling me that they came across my resume on indeed and that they think I would be a good fit for a position they had open. I&rsquo;m looking for work so I expressed my interest. I then received an email from Oscar Elliot, telling me that I was selected for a screening process and a chance to apply to the operations manager position they have available. They sent me the position information, including a high hourly pay rate and flexible hours. They then ask you to fill out an application and send it back where they accept your application right away. They then instruct me to download the messaging app &ldquo;telegram&rdquo; for communication. Once you message them in telegram, they tell you that they are setting up a 7-10 minute phone interview and coordinate it with you. The interview consisted of about 2 questions, my availability, and my strongest business asset and then telling me that I will be starting in a probationary period which will require me to use my own bank account to process payment from customers before sending it back to the company. I questioned them on this and they said they would never ask me to use my own funds for any transactions. After the quick phone &ldquo;interview&rdquo; I was immediately messaged on telegram by Oscar letting me know that I was selected and to choose which shift I wanted. (I stayed in the interview that I was unavailable to work for 2 weeks because I would have to give my current employer notice.) I read over the labour agreement and there were some fishy sections that I questioned them about, like a section that stated &ldquo;the employer is entitled to deduct from the employees compensation, or from any other compensation, in whatever form, any applicable deductions and remittances as required by law&rdquo;. When asked about this, Oscar stated that they would only deduct pay if you disappear. Which I found strange because that makes it seem like a lot of their employees &ldquo;disappear&rdquo;. I then became increasingly curious about the legitimacy of this so I did some digging and it was hard to find, but I found a forum warning people about the logistic company scams out there and their methods. A lot of it seems to be to either launder money or use employees as mules for goods bought with stolen credit cards. I reached the end of the thread where G-Transzone logistics was mentioned by name as a scam and felt it was my duty to report. I did not accept the position as there were far too many red flags and hope that this report discouraged others from accepting this position, as tempting as it looks.",

    "Description": "Contacted by Brian Switzer and given a telephone interview for a full or part-time, work from home remote data entry position for $20/hr. Red flags. He asked for references. He asked typing and data entry speed but didn't test for it. He was hard to understand. When I asked him questions he kept telling me to refer to the website for information. He explained that there is a two week training period of $16/hr and I would be given the equipment (laptop, printer) in order to do the work. Two days later I was offered the job. I was told I would be assigned a supervisor. I asked where I should go for my training and he indicated there wasn't a place where I would be trained. I asked how I would be trained then and he didn't answer. He didn't ask if I accept the offer, he just told me to sign the attached document he sent in an email. The email asks for bank account information ( a scan of a black voided cheque ) and a scan of my government pictured ID. There is no mention of a supervisor and no further information on the job itself. Through further research, I found a site that looked legit and a site that seemed to try to mirror the legit site but with some inconsistencies - the Toronto branch had a Detroit MI phone number as it's contact number. When called, the caller is directed to leave a message without any indication of the company called, where the legit looking website has a 1-888 # and when calling that number, the automated greeting clearly stated the company name and offered several options for contacting people within the organization. I called Brian Switzer's phone number by mistake thinking I was calling the BBB back, he answered \"Hello\" rather than answering the call by identifying who he is and identifying the company name. The contract was rife with formatting errors, spelling, and grammar errors. I really felt that if I gave my banking information, I would be scammed so I declined the offer and didn't sign any documents. I really didn't feel that I would be meeting with a supervisor and be given computer equipment to do any data entry work. I felt that once I gave that bank information, he would run with it.",

    "Description": "I am a student and try to look for a part-time job. I send some resumes to potential employers through indeed. A few days later I got an email from someone who claims his name is John Owens, the HR Manager of Canada reporters.\nIn the email, he told me my application was accepted. in order to complete the selection procedure,  I need to check on the job description and f then fill out an application form with some personal information like name, address, available hours for work and also 3 referees from former employers or teachers from school. In the application form it also states that if it's a part-time job, an interview is not required. I thought those are reasonable request, and maybe they will call later for a phone interview. so I completed the form and reply to Mr. John Owens.\nNext day morning, I received a job offer from Mr. Owens. He asks me to provide the scan copy of my passport and driver license so they will arrange insurance coverage for me. I feel suspicious as I am not quite convinced that anyone could get a job without an interview. so I google the company but I feel even more suspicious after googling it because below 3 reasons:\n1. I can't find any tracks of the company except their own website canadareport.ca and another almost identical website canadianreportersltd.ca.\n2. They claim they are news agency, but all articles are copied from Reuters but none of the articles indicates sources or authors/ reporters' name.\n3. The phone number on canadareporter.ca is the same with HR Managers'.\nI feel confused so I call Mr. Owens to ask their address and the relationship between Canada reporter and Canadian reporter ltd. The reply from Mr. Owen is that, they are in Toronto but they are moving to my city so they don't have the local address right now. These 2 websites are under the same media group, but right now they are independent. When I try to ask more professional questions like their article source, Mr. Owen said he can't hear me because the phone signal is not very well, therefore he asks me to write him an email. However, I didn't get any reply since.\nI am lucky that I did some research before send out my passport and driver license copy, but I wish BBB could do something to prevent this happening to the next victim.",

    "Description": "I was looking for a job online and someone sent me a message saying that the company she's working for is hiring and I should reply if I want any more details about it. So I emailed back without doubting because I'm desperately looking for a job.

The pay rate is $28-30 per hr and will also be paid $15/hr during the training session. The positions available are Data Entry and Customer Care and asked me which one I'm interested in.

So for now, all you need is your working Softwares to get started with your training.\"\n- I got connected with Mr Richard Bruno (Richard.01bruno@gmail.com), telling me that he's my supervisor and that I would have to report to him daily for my job duties and tasks to be carried out. He then sent me another interview questions which I answered.\nThis is where the red flags started:\n- The company will get you a business credit card for your transactions with the Company\nNOTE: There might be a delay in the delivery of your credit card due to some technical issues FedEx has been Encountering and also the weather conditions is some states. The credit card is being shipped from the Company Head-quarters here\n- You will get your Business Credit card within 7-14 days being a Company certified Credit Card...We will be making use of your Credit card for now. And I don&rsquo;t want you to be worried at all. The payment will be done from the Company account and none of it will be from your personal pocket.\n- The company will be making use of your credit card for now so you can get your working equipment as soon as possible and I don&rsquo;t want you to be skeptical at all\n- Remove every bit of skepticism you have within you and trust me Okay\n- The company needs to register your credit card accounting information into the financial payment system security data base, also secure your account with the accounting security system, which is done online and to also enable the company track the movement of the company's funds, to avoid the situation of a candidate running away with the company's money. You are advice to take out any available funds you have in it, so you won't say the company tempered with your money or account. The transfer process is completed automatically after being secured into the accounting security and payment system....\n- The payment won&rsquo;t be from your personal funds Okay\n- The company will be making a payment into your credit card for now so you can purchase your working equipment today and you will be getting it by weekend.\n- Good i need you to provide me with a clear snap of front and back of your credit card with the online information So payment can be made into it and you will head down to the store for the purchase of your working equipment (note that they said I would need to purchase my own equipment to an actual store)\nThey tried to put $5000 in my credit card but it wasn't working so they asked me for my debit card info which I stupidly gave without a thought. I did asked her why she needed my username and password when they could just transfer the money through my email and she snapped \"Is there a problem?\"\nThey did manage to deposit money to my debit card account $1,550 and $1800 the next day. She then asked me to pay $750 to my credit card so it's available to be used for I don't know what, withdraw $800 from my debit card to send via moneygram to Mr Banjo Oreoluwa CITY: Newark STATE: New Jersey ZIP CODE: 07112 and emphasized that i don't have to put any other information, and buy $1800 worth of steam gift cards all in $100 denominations.\nI told her I could only withdraw and send $500 because that's my limit on my card so i sent this person $500CAD ($366USD), she even got angry why it's only $366 so i told her that's the exchange rate. The next day I was asked to buy those steam gift cards and had to tell her again that i could only use $500 since it is my limit (per day but i didn't tell her that). She then insisted that there's no limit if I just swiped my card. I told her \"Mrs Bethany, card swipe here in Canada has limits in case of cards being stolen or fraudulently used.\" So she just asked me to proceed with the $500. I was already on my way out to my bank but my gut just kept telling me that this is a scam and thinking about it just screams scam and so many red flags so I did my research and found one on here that is very similar to my situation.\nI then emailed her that I no longer want the job and that it is in my best interest to do so because it just screams SCAM. I also sent her a screenshot of the same scam on here. I also changed all my credit and debit card info after as well as called to change my card numbers. She then sent me this: \"Let me be honest here with you There are so many scams out there and it has really made it difficult for people to know the difference between a legit job offer and a scam offer The scam companies are now using the exact same techniques of we the Legit company in hiring and its has really made it difficult I don&rsquo;t know why you still skeptical about this.\"\nI replied: \"I was on my way to the bank but then I questioned why I need to go buy those cards now when I'm still waiting for my working equipment? You said you're going to send them to me but why do I still need funds to buy it if you're sending them anyway? If you're a legit company then shouldn't you have done all of the purchasing yourself and just install all the software needed in the computer and send them to me?Also when I sent the moneygram there were so many restrictions you gave me and telling me to just tick the box like you're afraid to put any additional information at all. I'm a part time Cyber Security student and I'm being trained to know the red flags and where to look for scams and this just screams it. If it does turn out to be a scam then shame on me for believing, if not then I will apologize and transfer you back the money that hasn't been used as well as the money taken for my loans.

    "Description": "I received a telephone call from Ashley Z***** stating I had expressed interest in making money online. (It is possible that I clicked on such a link, although I had no specific memory of doing so.)  She played a recording that briefly described ** ******'s promo for obtaining \"agents\".  Then, a man named Michael F******* came on the line and further explained their offer.\nI am an affiliate marketer with 2 years experience.  I know quite a lot about how to sell online, what works and what doesn't work and what a legitimate offer looks and sounds like.  The ** ****** offer is a scam, in my opinion.  At the very least, it is filled with holes and some outright lies.\nAs explained by Mr. F*******, I could become an \"agent\" for the company and would not have to do any \"selling\" or spend any money on advertising.  All I would have to do is get leads for the company which, according to him, I could get via social media marketing for free or by talking with local businesses whenever I am out and about, and I would only need to spend 4 hours a week doing this to be successful.\nI would be compensated when the company closed a sale.  He said the company has 7 services they offer (I only found 6 on their website) and I would be compensated 25% of each sale. My compensation for some sales would be $1000.  As other people became agents in my territory, they would be placed under me and I would receive some compensation on their sales.\nThe compensation sounded like a two-tiered affiliate plan as apposed to an MLM, so I mentioned this and he agreed.  I asked if my leads would be \"lifetime\" leads and he said they would. (This means that if my lead purchases anything else from the company in the future, I would receive a commission for these sales too.  Two-tiered, lifetime affiliate compensation plans are fairly common and completely legitimate as far as I know.)\nMr. F******* said the cost for becoming an \"agent\" was $1500 which would give me a website, video training and conversations with other agents.\nHere are my complaints regarding this offer:\n1.  The claim that I would not have to do any \"selling\" is false, and frankly, ridiculous. Obtaining leads is a sales function/activity, so it is in no way removed from \"selling\".\n2.  The claim that I would not need to spend any money on advertising is equally false and ridiculous.  Free social media marketing alone would never produce the volume of leads that would be required for even just one sale.  Paid advertising plus free social media marketing is the only way to get enough leads because not every lead ends up making a purchase (just 10% would be a great rate, but even 10% is rare.)\n3.  The claim that the website/training/conversations is worth $1500 is VERY misleading, in my opinion.  Since the activities required are essentially affiliate marketing, it is very easy to find effective training online, completely free.  I believe the company is not being honest and transparent by not identifying that this offer is essentially a simple two-tiered affiliate marketing role. (Affiliate marketers are NEVER asked to pay anything to the companies they work with....NEVER....if the company is legitimately looking for affiliate marketers.)\n4.  The claim that I would only need to work 4 hours a week is also ridiculous.  Even 4 hours a day might not be enough, and I have 2 years experience. He claimed that there were agents making $3,000 to $5,000 per month and only needing to spend a few hours a day at most.  This would be great, if it were true.  For sure, a newbie could never expect to make that kind of money from only a few hours a day of work and not spending any money on advertising.\n5.  I am a Canadian, so I asked Mr. F******* if the company sold their services to Canadians.  He claimed that there were other Canadian \"agents\".  However, he had no knowledge of the different legal requirements for loans in Canada (one of their services is to help business owners get loans), and he seemed to think there were no signficant differences between Canada and the US in this regard.  He was excited about the fact that I was the first one in Ontario, so I would end up having lots of agents under me in the compensation plan, and therefore more passive income.  But he refused to give me time to find out if sales of their services was even allowed in Canada.\n6.  The sales tactics used by Mr. F******* were extremely \"hard-sell\" as indicated above.  When I said I wanted to do some research first before making a decision, he could have arranged another conversation with me, but instead, the only way I could end the call was to hang up on him. He actually freely admitted that I either had to make a purchase today or hang up on him, in order to end the call.\nIt was crystal clear that he had no interest in my inability to make an informed decision.\nFor all of these reasons, I believe that the ** ******&nbsp;offer is a scam.  And it is no surprise to me that they are selling it by phone instead of online, where their program would more likely be identified as a scam by many and not just me.  Even their website has no information about this offer.",

    "Description": "The person who claimed to hire me was ******* *******. They offered me a job of remote executive manager right away without any interview process. They preferred using email and telegram messaging to communicate. They asked me to provide my email address, phone number, and a picture of my license. They said to begin, I had to sign a labour agreement for a 10 day trial period. At this point I was getting very suspicious. On the first day of the trial period they wanted to discuss things over the phone. So I agreed to see if my instincts were correct. Turns out, they were. A man called, didn't state his name, said I had to complete a task in a timely manner and had many grammatical errors throughout the phone call. The first task was to sign up for various websites including, https://localbitcoins.com and https://squareup.com, and to receive money from their company to my bank account, via online Merchant, and convert it to bitcoins for their clients. Then, without me even completing the task, they said I qualify for a senior position that pays $2000/week. Very suspicious. I wanted to be certain it was a scam so I did some research on potential scams and checked through their company website. It was full of grammatical errors, vague descriptions, few reviews and on their events page they said they conduct courses in Hyderabad (India). So I sent them a message saying \"oh you hold events in Hyderabad, that's great! It's in India, right?\" And they haven't replied yet.\nI'm almost certain this is a scam or even worse, phishing so please everyone be careful! And I hope the authorities get involved to put an end to it.",

This time the e-mail was about Bitcoin and how I would be using it to make purchases for the clients. The company would send me 2-3 Interac transactions to fill up my Bitcoin wallet. They wanted to know my bank name, e-mail address associated with my account and phone number. I did not reply back to this e-mail as I then learned about the employment and cryptocurreny scam, so they did not give me any money, and did not get any from me.\nThere were a few things that I found suspicious such as some errors with spelling and grammar. Also, the \"hiring manager\" said this  in an e-mail: \"Because I am  your manager, and I have a few people in this position, I communicate via e-mail only.\" I thought it was bizarre that I didn't have an interview and that this person would only communicate by e-mail and not over the phone.

I told her I would return her call to see if I could get a better connection.  I called the number listed in her e-mail.  The recording promptly informed me that the number was \"unsigned\". I e-mailed her and told her the number listed in her e-mail was invalid.  It took a few hours but she finally got back to me and said that (and I quote)  \"You can not call us because we have a large flow of candidates, our line is constantly overloaded, because our line is connected with customer service.\"  I decided I didn't want to work for a company that was so disorganized and had decided I didn't like how things were not adding up.  I decided not to contact them again.  Low and behold two hours later, having completed no interview, I was forwarded a job offer and asked to provide personal documents.  That is about the time that it hit that there were looking for PERSONAL INFORMATION.  I went back into my e-mail and realized that these e-mails did NOT come through indeed like the rest and that I was being scammed.  What can I say?  I am blond :)",

    "Description": "On October 28th, 2018. I had applied for an online employment (working from home) position. In which they were looking for 2 people to hire for online payment processing out of the Moncton NB office. Noted to me that it is a Toronto based digital advertising company that is rapidly growing. Also noted that all training would be done in Moncton NB. So it seemed very legit. After discussing with this person about employment for several days, he then advised that in order to meet with the team that I was to require a new personal bank account with CIBC, TD, or RBC to work well with their system. Which at that time, I thought it may have been for direct deposit. So I did. We had been discussing a meeting for 10 days. Finally he tells me that the only way that I was to meet was if I had client card and all documentation in hand. (meaning he then could see all my personal info). It did send a major red flag. After he advised this, I declined the position immediately.\nHe then responded with a very angry and offensive email.. In which I will attach the response.",

    "Description": "I got an email from a guy who called himself Rick Murphy thanking me for filling out an application on their company website. I had been looking for a job recently but did not remember doing that. I will copy and paste the exact email he originally sent me at the end. He attempted to call me every day in the morning which was odd because I had given him a time to best get me and that was way out of the time slot. He left a voicemail saying &ldquo;this is Rick Murphy please call me back &ldquo; but didn&rsquo;t leave a phone number but I had call I&rsquo;d on my phone. Anyways I tried calling that number back and the first few times it would just keep on ringing and there was never an answering machine or anything. The last few times I called it would ring twice and then a busy signal. I emailed him telling him I tried calling there was no answer or answering machine blah blah and never heard back until a few days later when he emailed me saying he&rsquo;s tried calling and didn&rsquo;t get me and to call him back on the number I had already been calling so he did finally give me a number but not until towards the end of about 5 days. I then tried a few more times and got the same result when I called so I sent him an email saying I&rsquo;m not sure what to do as I&rsquo;ve tried calling. I then tried looking up the company and the only one I could find was in the UK. So all of those things together made me realize it&rsquo;s a scam so I want to warn people. Luckily I didn&rsquo;t and would never give out any banking info and I&rsquo;m not sure how he got my information to begin with although I have been applying to a bunch of places through Indeed so maybe they had a fake add or something. I&rsquo;m gonna copy and paste the exact words from the first email he sent me so you know what to look out for:\nThank you for filling out our application form and reading the information on our company&rsquo;s website.\nBefore a phone interview, I&rsquo;d like to tell you more about the duties that come with the position.\nYour workday will start with processing requests from our sales managers.

They were opening an office in my area and wanted to know if I was interested in the opportunity. I did find it odd, but I had posted my resume on a number of job sites and I spoke to some friends who said that they have been contacted the same way. I responded that I was interested in obtaining more info. A follow up email was sent with a number of positions that were available and I was asked to chose the one I was most inserted in and to answer six questions such as do I enjoy working in a team. I found that the questions were worded a bit strange. I did not respond and the next day I received a follow up email stating a sense of urgency for me to submit my answers. I advised I would submit them shortly. The next day I had not submitted them and I received again a follow email asking where my responses were. I did some reseach and the company had a website but again something seemed off. The questions that were asked were not of a personal nature and I did not require that I provide any specific information about my past jobs etc. I submitted the answers and then I received a response asking me to provide photo ID, complete and sign the attached employment agreement and then I would be contacted by an interview representative. The end of the email had a paragraph stating that by signing the agreement I am bound to the commitment I have made. I the employment agreement did not state a wage, a job location or any details concerning start dates etc. At this point I was convinced this was a scam. I did not respond. But I am certainly reporting this scam. Pylo fiance Inc.",

When I had replied that I was, it was following by further emails to advise me to pick a position I was interested in and outlined the details of the employment.  I was then required to submit my identification information as well as sign an employment contact.  This individual_ congratulated me on joining their company and then advised me that further contact would be made regarding the job position and interview.  I was to email them at 9:00 am in the morning and when I did, they further followed with an email regarding my first training task.  It started by saying that I would need initial capital and outlined that it would be for funds for software, online trading, online purchases, bill payments, equipment procurement, paid advertising orders, trade operations and any working experience.  She then advised that I will not spend any of my own money on this and advised that the company uses bit coins for the initial capital and that I was to exchange the money on Bitcoin.  She reported that the accountant would send me an interac e-transfer - $2000.  I was go go to the nearest bank branch or ATM and withdraw the money and then go to the nearest Special Bitcoin ATM and exchange the money on Bitcoin.She advised me to exchange the $1,950.00, and reported that they would then pay me the $50 for the day's work.  She provided me with a Bitcoin ATM at 13402 66 St NW, Edmonton T5C 0B6.  She reported that the company would give me the money to take the taxi to this location or to take my own vehicle and they would give me the money to buy the gas.  I was also to watch the accompanying video (which I did not and began to recognize some fraudulent form of activity being provided to me).  The further actions in this email advised me to perform these actions without wasting time or pursuing other tasks and to keep her informed  and respond immediately to report on what steps I had taken.  She inquired as to how much time I would require to complete the task and stated that she was here to help me.    At this time, I emailed her back to report that I was uncomfortable in the way she pursued the employment hiring with her company and asked her to severe the employment contract.  She continued to send me emails to inquire as to why and again attempted to suggest that this was a secured and safe practice and I informed her that I did not require her $20 per hour job when I was making double that with my past employment and requested that she refrain from any further contact or emails with me.  From that point she sent a final email to advise that I had signed an employment contract as as per the contract, it would be cancelled in 7 day notice period.  This was after I sent several emails to suggest that I was on the short list for **** ********** ****&nbsp;and could not be associated with work I did not feel comfortable with (this was the truth on my part).",

However, the grammar used in the email was poor, so I checked the website, at first glance, it&rsquo;s a beautiful site and looks legit, but as you scroll to the bottom to check their comments by clients, it seems their clients have the same poor grammar and they don&rsquo;t actually specifically say how great this company is or how they helped their own companies. These comments say that their own companies are global leaders, and with the money from ibrccc, they were able to be international. I find it strange for a &ldquo;global leader&rdquo; they need financial help to be international? When I checked the BBB site for this company, the name Northpine came up, makes me think that these guys just keep rebranding themselves to pull the same scams.",

We have made our customer aware of you as the company representative in Canada, Attached is an invoice on the goods purchased. Do present to him with the Invoice attached. He has informed us he would be traveling out of Canada for a business trip and we would want him to remit payment before traveling for his trip, he has promised to remit the whole amount in installments and we would want him to remit first installment payment before he leaves for his trip.\nFind below the customer's contact detail:\nBRYAN KUDRO\nEASTERN TRADE &amp; MARKETING COMPANY LTD\nE-MAIL:Bkudro@easterntmc.com\nTEL: +1204-291-5237\nFAX: +1204-594-5550\nKindly contact him via call or email and follow up with the payment.

    "Description": "I had my resume posted on job search sites as I'm seeking employment. I was contacted by someone claiming to be from HR with Elite Worldwide Logistics about a high paying position in payment processing. The sent a job description and application, someone contacted me from the company number to explain the position, but this was not like a phone interview it was just a guy telling me about the position in which he explained a 10-day trial period in which I would use my own account until my company account was set up to process payments from their clients. When I questioned him about this he said my manager would be able to better explain and would work with me to ensure I knew the job. The man had a heavy accent, so I just told him to get this \"manager\" to contact me. I then received an email asking for my ID, and payroll deposit (bank account) info, which I did not provide. I had called the number they called from and sent a test email to their info email address, the phone number was not assigned and the email bounced back. I responded to the original email asking for a crossable phone number that I could speak with someone to ensure the company was a legitimate company, as I was not comfortable sending my personal info via email. The person responded with an email saying that I could not contact them as their lines are overloaded with candidates and connected to their customer service lines, she then asked if I was no longer interested in the position in which I responded \"No\"! Who would work for a company they cannot contact, I am not sure. Anyway so far I haven't lost anything and they only have my resume information, but it did waste a lot of my time, so I'm slightly ticked off. Hopefully no one actually gives them their info and checks sites like these first, who knows what would have happened had they received my ID and banking info. Be careful people!",

Then I researched and found out there has been a case about Tritax sending fake money order.\nSo I replied with this:\nDear Kevin,\nI am declining your job offer with full force. Henceforth, the job offer letter I signed is now deemed invaluable and worthless. Moreover, I have reported your organization to the appropriate authorities for attempts to swindle and defraud me through a job offer scam.\nThanks but no thanks.",

    "Description": "I was contacted by someone at American Income Life or AIL Financial as the girl on the phone referred to it saying they saw my resume on Indeed and wanted to do some screening questions. I never ever applied for employment with this organization and played along with some general questions which were about working as a Supervisor which I have absolutely zero experience in. Clearly I was not qualified to work in insurance but the girl on the phone said I was a \"good fit\" and should come in for an interview tomorrow at 8pm at night. I  was already extremely suspicious as I never actually applied to the company but an 8pm job interview sounds extremely shady to me and I said no I was no long interested. The girl then became aggressive with me and said I wasn't \"keeping my options open\" so I promptly hung up on her. This is not a good way to recruit potential employees to a company and from what I read online about AIL they expect employees to pay education and administrative fees over over 300 dollars each just to work there.",

They sent a lot of information about the position, the job responsibilities, information about the company, and a website to read all about the company. They also sent contracts and official paperwork that was stamped and signed by the company and HR, everything looked very official and professional. They explained they are a company that sells music software and their customers purchase it using bitcoin. I had agreed to try the trial period and she explained about managing multiple candidates during this trial and that we will be assigned tasks and taught slowly over the course of the trial how to do more aspects of the job and that the trial would be work from home but we would be in contact through phone and email and have to send reports of our tasks. She explained over the first part of the trial we will not be in contact with the customers yet but that a specific case would be assigned to us and they would see how we interact with the client and sell the products. For the first day she called and spoke with me and explained that her &ldquo;financial department&rdquo; was going to transfer me money and she would go through the process of how they accept the payments and process them/want them transferred to bitcoin. I was contacted by my bank asking about the transfer and they explained it was stolen from someone&rsquo;s account in Quebec. at this point the woman stopped responding to any emails or calls when I tried to contact her after finding this out.",

They said that I was qualified for the job, and they described the job description and other factors they had to offer, such as an hourly rate of $29.50 for part-timers. I accepted the offer and kept in contact with the HR manager, hoping that this opportunity would lift some of my financial burdens (e.g. car loan, student loan, etc.). After I had accepted, the HR manager sent me documents such as a labour agreement form and an employment authorization form. Everything seemed so legitimate that I sent in my ID (in which I covered my DOB and ID# ); I also sent my direct deposit information. It was not till after I sent my information that I realized there was something suspiscious about the entire process. For starters, the HR manager asked me to add her on Telegram, and she was really eager for me to send her my documents. After I had sent my information, I was set for a phone interview with the \"call center manager\", and that was when I knew it was a scam. The \"call center manager\" did not give me her name, she kept on asking me about my banking info (e.g. if I used a chequing or savings account), and she said that my personal bank account would be used at one point in time to complete the job. I did not disclose anymore information about myself during the phone call. The hunch in my gut led me to do more research, and I found someone on Indeed who was also contacted by the same company. I asked her about whether or not it was normal for an HR manager to contact me through Telegram, and the person replied telling me NOT to keep in contact with that company anymore as she knows that terrorists use Telegram to get to others. I blocked the so-called HR Manager on Telegram, and I am now in talks to change my banking info with my bank.",

    "Description": "Either these people/person are very dumb and scammers or they are very dumb.  i applied to a grocery delivery job on indeed.com just for something to do on the weekend occasionally as my kids are spending less time with me as they get older.  His name is Abdifatah.  I met him in a shopping mall and sat at the food court.  I found his information on linkedin which showed his picture so I knew who he was when we met.  he started to tell me that his company takes orders for groceries and he hires shoppers, like me to go and get the items and deliver to the client.  Before going into the pay information he said all he needs is my banking information.  I said you must be mistaken because if you are for real this is a scam.  I suggested he probably meant email money transfers.  he didn't seem to have a clue about that.  he talked a bit saying he has 110 customers and 11 drivers in Calgary.  His Zallat linkedin account shows 6 followers and 3 employees!  On facebook there are about 3 or 4 people that like his comments on Zallat and they are all friends of each others, and all from same culture; I think Somalia.  some of the facebook prfiles all have the same saying about allah.  he didn't seem to have a clue about things and went with the flow of how i was asking questions.  he said that most of the clients are lawyers and doctors as i said i work for a few doctors. LOL  he told me he would email me the expectations and he never did.  i sent him a text to 587-432-**** to remind him and he said 'my bad' and he will do it right away.  i never got the email (3 days ago).  he told me to email or call on the website my availability by sunday for the week ahead.  this information i felt he made up on the spot as i was asking what day you would need to email availability by.  he said the pay scale is $5 per order and you get 7.5 % of total grocery bill. LOL.  his fees on the site show $19.99 a month for unlimited deliveries if you buy over $35 each time.  or a yearly fee of $149 with unlimited deliveries.  LOL  if a customer does 10 orders in a month you are paying the delivery person 10 times $5 = $50 plus 7.5 % of total groceries.  the company would have to be losing $ right and left.  if you look online for Zallat you will find his picture.  he is the darker toned person.  2 Asian people are supposedly they computer programmers.  i think he is trying to get people who have no clue and perhaps get them to do a test deposit to him or something as he tested me with saying he would need my banking information.  his tune changed after that.  his website also says you need a criminal check but nothing was every done; no paperwork; no forms; no nothing.   just talking to me to see if I am gullible enough.  i do not know why he has his picture on the website and linkedin though.  very bad website.",

I was skeptical since the salary was too high but then I consulted some friends with similar jobs and they said it is quite normal. Moreover, they hadn't mentioned my name even once in their letter. I confirmed my availability anyway since I trust LinkedIn and their webpage seemed quite professional. Then they asked me to pay around 1900 US dollars that made me really suspicious.

The website offers 3 preselected options when an employer reaches out so I selected \"interested\" in the offered job. I then received an additional email somewhat outlining the job they were offering, the full/part time positions, hourly pay. The email was missing 2 key components of the job however, the company name as well as the location of employment. I responded to the email asking to for the company name and location of employment (thinking it may have been an overlooked human error in the first message). The response came with the company name, a more detailed description of the job as well as the location of employment - home based. The company name provided actually did not match with the very first message I received, the out of home employment was suspicious considering the wage they were offering. I looked into the company \"Safe Logistics Inc\" and found an almost nonexistent online presence for a company claiming on their website to have been around for 20+ years. While I was on their website I did notice a couple small spelling errors, something unusual on a 'well established' international organizations website. Finally, the name of the individual emailing me was Katrin, however her 'company' email contained the name Kathrin, another small but overlooked detail. Based on what I encountered and similar things I seen online when looking up their company I believe this 'shipping' company was looking for an address to send packages to me and have me forward them on to additional locations. This company has no presence on corporate sites such as LinkedIn, no offices in Calgary or Alberta despite advertising as a shipping company. Additionally the number provided (area code from Quebec) is not in service.",

    "Description": "I applied for a freelance writing position in mid August and received an email soon after stating I was qualified for the position. They sent a contract to me to sign, stating I will be paid 20$ per published article between the 10th and the 14th of the month. So I spent a lot of time and effort writing articles, to which I had 25 published articles which means I should have been paid over 500$. Things started getting very weird when I emailed them on September 15th when I didn't receive any payment. I was never even told the payment process. They simply did not reply to my email and I still haven't been paid. I then started contacting the other writers on the site via Facebook. 4 other writers all stated they were in the same situation as me and we all agreed it was a fraudulent scam. Whoever created this site is getting writers to write and submit articles for which they will never be paid. I now understand they are doing this across a number of different sites. www.washingtonnewsday.com\nwww.floridamorningpost.com\nwww.guyanaguardian.com\nThese are the three sites that I know are all fraudulent scams. Whoever is doing this is scamming people out of thousands and thousands of dollars. I wasted many many hours writing to which I will never see payment for. I hope that these sites can me taken down and whoever is responsible is charged. Someone told me the person in charge of these scams is named Dennis Adonis. Even the phone number given on the site is just a bogus voice mail. Please help. I have evidence of other users stating the same thing as well as former employee reviews that have written on glassdoor.com to warn people of this.",

The first thing that I found odd was that when I looked up the Address on their \" CAD and US head office \" The Miami office did not even come up and aside from their own web site there was no real virtual presence for a business that advertised virtual services.  The business did not show on Miami's Business lists and then the biggest thing was seeing other reports on the BBB scam site that was exactly like what I got.  Even more suspicious they offered me the job even though \"******* had technical difficulty and did not even interview me\" when I pressed her for more information she provided nothing but the same information provided before.  Obviously I did not pursue but I would assume they would have followed up with the same things they did to other people that reported this company because they did say that the job would offer me all of the physical items I need ie lap top, printer, scanner",

    "Description": "All this started two weeks ago. I recently graduated and was looking for a part-time job opportunity until I find some full-time regular job position. I applied to so many jobs that sometimes I can not even remember that I applied for the particular job position. I received an email on 5th of Sept 2018 from CANEWS.TODAY and they claimed they reviewed my resume on indeed and they want to offer me a position of Quality Control Agent. It was a part-time position with a trail of 30 Business Days. They wanted me to go to the different places like bank, mall, hotel and Restaraunt as a customer to check their service and get back to them with the survey form that they provided me. First two days were good and I never realised that it was a scam, they sent me to a restaurant and mall for the first two days. On Wednesday the 12th of sept, 2018, they didn't send me an email regarding my task so I emailed them that I didn't receive and task and they said their server is down so I am off today. On Thursday the 13th of sept, 2018, they called me and said I need to go to the Scotiabank today and check their customer service as they received a complaint that they take more than 40 minutes on one customer. Afterwards, he said he will send me an interac and I need to deposit that money into my Scotia bank account and send them back immediately to their company via Bitcoin ATM. I asked them if it is compulsory to do that as I was not feeling good to use my account to accept or withdraw the money. I told him that I am already a Scotiabank customer so I can ask the question regarding my account to check their quality of service but he denied me to do that and he said if I want to work with CANEWS.TODAY as a quality control agent or not as he manipulated me that he can promote me as a manager if I can keep doing this job according to their rules and regulations. I asked him that I am not feeling secure about using my bank account but he assured me that CANEWS.TOADY is reputed and dignified company and nothing negative will happen on my bank account. He claimed that CANEWS.TODAY will pay for all the charges and expenses happen to my account. I did as he told me to do and he provided me with the location of bank and bitcoin atm. He sent me two interact e  transfer with the amount of $1990.80 and $1985.00 and I deposited the whole amount back in the bitcoin atm. When I get home I opened an account to check one of my payment that was supposed to go on 14th of Sept, 2018 but I was unable to open my bank account on the mobile app. Then I logged in to my web to see if there is any kind of problem with my mobile app and then I came to know that my bank account is suspended. I called the Scotia bank right away and customer representative asked me if everything is okay at that point I was unable to hold anything back and I told her everything. Next day I went to my bank and got the new card. On Saturday that is today, my friend sent me an interact on my email when I tried to deposit into my bank account they said I need to contact my financial institute to check if everything is alright. I called my bank and them and my email is in the fraudulent list and they need few business days to resolve this and they will contact me and interact department if they need any further information. Now my mail is in the fraudulent list and my friend who sent me an interact of $500, his money is on hold and they sent his email in the fraudulent department for further investigation. When I filled a job application for CANEWS.TODAY they wanted me to send my identification proof. I sent them my DL as an identity proof but now I know they are fraud and I do not want them to use my personal ID. I do not want this to happen with someone else so I am willing to provide all their emails that they sent me so any action can be taken against them. Below are the email and phone number that they were using to contact me. CANEWS.TODAY email is careers@canews.today and phone number is 604-283-4770. I still do not believe all this happened to me. I cannot shake the feeling of this fear. I didn't lose any money but I wasted my time and gas and now I am having trouble with my bank accounts. I cannot sleep properly because they are still out there and can use my information on anything. Thank you for your time and please let me know if I can take any further action against this person.",

    "Description": "verview\nThe job/employment scam takes advantage of those who are seeking work.\nIndividuals are offered a job without needing to have an in-person meeting with the employer. The target is asked to receive money from an unknowingly-compromised bank account.\nThey are then asked to withdraw cash in order to purchase bitcoins.These bitcoins are, in turn, sent to the wallet address of the scammer.\nDemographic of targets: The elderly, recent immigrants, the young (students with little knowledge of legal systems), and workers who receive payment under the table\nHow it Works\nThe scammer will contact a job seeker through an email, or phone call, and offer them a job. If the job seeker believes that this job offer is legitimate, they will accept their offer and follow the scammers&rsquo; subsequent instructions.\nThe instructions will involve funneling money from a compromised bank account controlled by the scammer, into the target&rsquo;s bank account; this is done via Interac e-Transfer. The target will then be instructed to withdraw most of the transferred money, with the difference being the target&rsquo;s compensation. The target is then requested to use the withdrawn money to purchase bitcoins at a Bitcoin ATM, and send them to the scammer&rsquo;s wallet address. When the compromised bank account&rsquo;s holder discovers money missing, they will report it to their local authorities, who will ask the bank to reverse the transaction. After the transaction is reversed, the target will be left at a loss, having already withdrawn the money sent to them.\nPrevention: Stay Alert\nThe majority of jobs will require a physical presence for an interview. Always be skeptical when being offered a job. Be particularly cautious of any jobs that claim to be &lsquo;remote&rsquo; or &lsquo;work-from-home&rsquo;. Be wary of any job offers made on-the-spot, through an email or a phone call, and without an interview. It is also very important that you  never accept money transfers from anyone you do not know. Most certainly, the chances are that the funds are coming from a compromised bank account. A job will also most certainly never involve conducting business out of a target&rsquo;s personal bank account. Any job that is easy to obtain, with easy pay, is most likely too good to be true. It is always good to have a healthy dose of skepticism.",

    "Description": "As I am currently unemployed, I have been looking for jobs on a lot of job sites and applying to a lot of different positions. As a result of this I had not been keeping track of which companies I had applied to. Thus, when Charlotte Natoc of Verttag Corporation contacted me with a job offering, I assumed it had been one that I had applied to. The first email I received was asking me to email back if I was interested in the job. The second email I received had an attachment describing the positions available, which were basic office jobs, as well as the pay. There was also a 5 day training period. I was asked to choose which position I was interested in, as well as answering a few basic questions: How do you feel about working in a team; What do you need to feel comfortable at work; What position are you most interested in; Why are you the best candidate for the respective position; What are your best personal qualities; When would you be ready to start working. About 6 hours after receiving the second email, I received another asking if I had received the email and to respond as soon as possible. I assumed that they were just trying to be nice at this point, and sent off my responses to the questions. The next email I received asked me to fill out an employee contract and send a copy of an official ID. It was at this point I started to get suspicious of the company. I had previously searched the internet for any information on this company, as well as looking at their company website. They are registered with a certified business number on the Canada Government website, as well as many others, and their website looks pretty legitimate. However, when I called their listed phone number there was no response and not even a voicemail. In hind-site, this should have been enough to convince me, but I was still really interested in the position as it had good pay and I thought I would really enjoy the job as it had been described to me. So I filled out the employee contract, with my basic information (name, address, contact information, signature) and sent a photocopy of my driver's licence with the master number erased, as I was still unsure of the security of my information. The next email I received was to congratulate me on becoming a member of their company. Up to this point I had not spoken to any one other than this one individual by email, I had not had a formal interview of any sort (just the few questions I had answered), and I had not even been told where the position would be located, as it was an office job. This email continued to ask me for my banking information so that they could set up my payments. At this point I dug deeper into this organization. Their address, when searched, is actually for a business called \"Ontario Consumers Home Services\". While the Canada Government website does have them listed as a business, it is very unclear what they actually do. And finally, I called their listed number a few more times, and still there was no response. At this point I was pretty skeptical that this business was legitimate, so I responded to the email stating that I was happy to be offered the position, but I refused to give anymore information until I talked or met with someone, and was told where the office was located. The response I received is attached below, and basically told me that this was standard procedure and I should feel comfortable with the security of my information with them. Besides the emails I have described above, there were about 3 additional emails in-between that asked me if I had received the information sent previously and to respond asap, even though the total length of our contact was about 3 days. However, since my last email, asking about the security of my information, I have not received any other emails, therefore I can say this 100% appears to be a scam. I am not sure what the procedure is to obtain a business number, but I have to believe that these people have been quite successful at scamming people, as they have gone out of their way obtain a business number and to make their company appear very legitimate at first glance. I hope that you can shut down this business so that they don't continue to scam unemployed individuals at such a vulnerable time.",

The job entails to work from home online, and you have a 10 day trial period. Great pay and flexible hours so it does sound to good to be true. I spoke with Miya ***** the \"HR, representer,\" for the company and just speaking with her and trying to clarify my concerns I knew I was not confidence to continue, I did more research on the task I was given, anything that relates to linking your personal financial account and taking money out of it and depositing the money into a Bitcoin machine account just did not sound right. I did more research and the story just sounded like many other scams. I emailed her saying I am sorry, but this is a scam and I will report you, at first she was so eager to answer my emails and after that I have not heard from her.\nPlease watch out",

Firstly, their phone number does not work, secondly, their testimonials repeatedly mention the company \"Golden Review\" and a single individual \"Jen Wells\"... not only one person works at a company. The most hilarious line within their website is, \"We don&rsquo;t just hire &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; and we certainly don&rsquo;t mass-hire everyone who applies\", which is DEFINITELY something that someone who does exactly that would assert.\nThese scammers are stupid and malicious, preying on desperate just-graduated individuals who are looking to survive in this capitalist driven ******** of an existence. The most IRONIC thing is that they're\" hiring\" inspectors, who would be very detail oriented and attentive to any strange occurrences, and thus would be most attuned to picking up on these red flags.\nAnyways, they had a short phone interview with me, asking about myself and my job experiences, asking whether I was interested in part or full time employment. Immediately after the phone call I was provided with a job offer, where I had a contract to sign and a T4 sheet...no banking information page/direct deposit form so they would be able to actually pay me.. but they're a scam so that's actually not necessary.

They said we are going to open new office in your area so we need a good staff. They said we are going to hire you within 2 days then 10 days of probation period. On the second day of probation period they inform me that they deals in bitcoin hence there client will send me fund in my personal account via e-intrac transfer. In few minutes I got an email stating that mr. x has intiated fund transfer of $2700. I found the process fishy and decline to do whatever they kept been saying. Now I have been getting thrashing emails and phone calls",

Post my confirmation of interest in the job profile, their coordinator, Tracy Jensen, sent an employee application form and contract for signing up, with your picture. They told me that I was the 1st candidate on their list of 20. After I sent out the signed contract, she told me that I have arrange for an office setup immediately which needs to be opened in Montreal and in September they need to open similar office in Toronto. I was told that I have to step by step follow her instructions, that she would keep sending me through 'Telegram' app. She told me that they need to buy furniture from China for the new office. I sniffed scam/fraud when the first task she gave me was to transfer cash from my personal account to 'Bitcoin' (to pay the vendors from whom furniture would be bought)- As per her, she would sent me money through 'interac' in my personal account, which I would have to withdraw (Cash)from my account and deposit in Bitcoin. When I questioned her repeatedly that why I should use my personal account for work (since every penny coming in my account would be taxable but I would be paying it off to vendors - hence its not my income), she said it is to check that the new hired employee is reliable. On my further questions, she VANISHED AWAY from 'telegram' append took off her picture as well :). I'm just happy that i'm saved and wish you also don't fall in the trap",

I looked up the 2 phone numbers and called them and one phone number rang and then stopped and the other phone number had a male automated voicemail which is fake. Upon searching online through reverse look up the the phone number showed as a VOIP account so a texting application.

They were going to send me a laptop, and funds to purchase software for the computer that I would need in order to do the data entry.\nThat all sounded good and fine.  They told me I had to report online the next day at 9 am.  At 844am they started messaging, and told me the computer would be shipping the following day, and I would have everything in 2 days.\nIn the meantime, they needed my bank info so they could \"send me money\".  Yet they asked for my login and password, and security question and password (RED FLAG RIGHT THERE).  I told them that they can E-transfer me the money and I will tell them when I had it.  At this point I was very suspicious and started digging around online, and all the little clues came together.\nNo international company would be using their company name and the year as their email address, nor would they be using a @GMAIL.COM account.\nI feel like a COMPLETE IDIOT for falling for this, and wasting all that time and energy, and I hope noone else falls for this despicable, disgusting, pathetic, scam.\nI DID NOT lose any money, but I very easily could have.  As it stands, I am concerned about these individuals knowing my name, address, and having a copy of my drivers license.",

I did not get interviewed.

This leads me to believe this was the same scam, probably arranged for by the same people.\nI checked both companies and they are both federally registered in Canada, i.e. they are both in the Corporations Canada online database. So beware! Even doing my due diligence by confirming if the company was listed, they were still operating scams, or at least attempting to.

We're glad to welcome you!\nIt is my pleasure to extend the following offer of employment to you from Coinbase.\nAfter reviewing your resume, we would like to offer you the position of Customer Support - Remote.\nYour experience will be an asset to our company.\nFounded in June 2012, Coinbase is a digital currency wallet and platform where merchants and consumers can transact with new digital currencies like bitcoin.\nAn open financial system is one that is not controlled by any one country or company (just like the internet did for distributing information).\nWe think this is the highest leverage way to bring about more economic freedom, innovation, efficiency, and equality of opportunity in the world.\nWe have a ten-year plan to get there.\nAt the moment, we have open positions in Canada.\nYou can see more information by clicking on the link https://www.coinbase.com/about.\nIf you are interested please reply to this email for further discussion.\nWe will be glad to welcome you as part of our team Coinbase.\nDuring the training, you will be paid 100 US dollars daily.\nAfter passing the training, you will have a meeting with a top manager, and you will discuss your schedule and salary together.\nUsually, it is from 67,000 dollars a year.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions I will provide any additional information to you.\nMain Office in Canada 201 Portage Ave Portage &amp; Main, Winnipeg.\nThey sent a youtube link and a pdf with job description as well. Strangely, the person did not sign their name at the end of the email. I was applying for jobs using only one website and I could not find this company there. I also do not apply to these kinds of jobs, not being very technology-inclined. I am sure that I did not apply to this company. My resume on the jobsite is linked with childcare. I do not have experience. The money amount they are offering seems like way too much and the fact it is in U.S. dollars (I am Canadian) seems suspicious as well. The address in Manitoba is also written strangely.  Plus, I would think that a tech company would have a company email and not just have gmail addresses. They seem like a legitimate business, so maybe a scammer is using the company name. I don't know. I decided it must be a scam and will have had no further contact with them.",

So, I thought this check was original and I proceed paying the shipping for the laptops. 3 days after my account was frozen and totally blocked because of this fraud and the check was refused and now I owe to the bank more than $2,900.00.\nAfter this situation, I start to backtrack everything about this scammer.

    "Description": "I was laid off and looking for something I could do from home.I saw an advert on-line to start your own business, and I responded - the biggest mistake of my life. I got a call from Dave Thomas of Bedrock Media telling me how fantastic there system was and how easy it was to make money - every bodies dream right! He made all sorts of promises, and I believed him. I explained that I did not have the money, and he told me that if I took out a loan for the $2500, I would have it paid in 3 months. I explained to him that if it does not work, I would not even have food in my house, as I am not employed. He still managed to convince me that it would work. I managed to get a loan, but had to have it paid back in 3 months. I transferred the money to Bedrock, and then the problems started. They promised to have the website up and running in a week. It was there, but nobody could access it. After 3 months of constant calls, I was told that there was a system era, and that they could give me a new website, but it would cost more money - really I have not received anything for the money I have already paid, now they want more! I opted out and wanted my money back, after about 4 months, they agreed to pay me half of the money, but even after calling Amy and Sara for 3 months every second day, I still never received a cent. I had to pay back the loan, so I never paid any of my other bills, had no job or income. Needless to say I am still trying to catch up on all the bills I did not pay because of this scam, and there were days when we never even had food in the house. I can't believe that these people are so ruthless. Oh by the way, they have no accounting department, and they have no managers, and their company policy is to never ever call you back.",

The documents that were allegedly from the Frank Stronach Family Real Estates company were clearly not associated with that company. He also sent documents that were allegedly from the Government of Canada. There were so many red flags on these documents:\n1. The LMIA came with a border that looked like it was made using an ancient version of Microsoft Word\n2. The contact numbers for Mr FRANK STRONACH both come up as possible scam numbers on Google\n3. The Canadian flag logo is blurry and looks like it came from a low quality GIF\n4. There is something called an \"Opinion Expiry Date\"\n5. They included the names of other \"New Employees (First Batch)\", which would never happen as it is a breach of confidentiality\n6. They say the position is for Engineering but that the occupation is not regulated\n7. There are minor punctuation and grammatical errors\n8. They ask for an immediate payment of $1542 CAD for a work permit\n9. The email address for the \"Canadian Immigration Home Office\" ends with -immi-gc.com to make it mimic an official Government of Canada email address\n10. The phone number for the \"Canadian Immigration Home Office\" starts with \"+91-\"\nI could go on and on.\nI don't know who else to report this scam to, or what else I can do about it.

When you go to web site and check its history you will see it was created only 2 months ago, even calling the phone number they put giving no results, and for their bad luck they said they have many branches one in Dubai where I tried to search online and didn't get any results.\nFraud or Scam mean is simple, you have the offer, but you pay for visa application and once you get your residence visa you come here and we pay you back. Of course no decent company is doing that, and the answer as expected is gonna be Visa is rejected and no refund to you.",

    "Description": "First she contacted me by email her name was Rachel Tennyson. I never applied for this position. They gave me option for 2 positions operations manager or cash manager. The operation manager position offered 108,900 annually and the cash manager position was 89,000. They said I was there top choice out of 20 people. As I read the email I noticed she spelt words wrong and made small punctuation errors the first email looked copied and pasted.\nThe forms they sent seemed legit all spelled correctly even the last forms seemed to have a stamp of approval. They gave me the job after filling out 2 forms and no phone call. The number they did give when you call it all you get is a robots voice all lines are full call back later. Sounded like a voicemail beep at the end.\nI did some research they have a employee comment on glass door but it was only positive. Also they are hiring everywhere to work on the machines but only one legit business location no head office just contact numbers. The website seemed very thoroughly made. Kind of expensive but the number again was robotic with no official head office location.\nI called the Kelowna branch they were legit. They said this is the second time they have been called this month. The other position was a relocation job to Quebec and it paid 104,000 annually. This was a machinist position. They told them they aren&rsquo;t hiring for that job there vacancy was full. Unfortunately the Operation Manager refused to talk to me as well.\nIt wasn&rsquo;t a fake email it had @machiningltd.com at the end. So again I didn&rsquo;t see any problem with it. They also said no phone interviews will happen because they information will be confidential so no information will be leaked to their competition.\nThan they made download an app called telegram messenger. Where they would contact me through that again no phone interview. My suspicion arrived when they said that bitcoin would be how the customers pay. How you will pay for an office. How you pay for supplies with bitcoin. This is where I declined the position and deleted everything.",

    "Description": "I'm a newcomer to Canada, and so I was applying for many jobs online. One day, I get this job offer to work online for a recruiting company, and the salary was very high, so immediately I was more than happy to take the job. I first had to do the training for 10 days, which was what they called my \"probation period\", and everyday we had to do a task. I only got to do two, the first being, posting a job offer on Indeed, and the second one being, receiving $1500 in the bank through INTERAC e-transfer (which works when you give only your name, your email,and the address of the bank you use)  and depositing it in a Bitcoin ATM for a client. Now I looked up a lot of things about bitcoins because I didn't know whether to trust them or not, and they seemed trustworthy, it seemed like a lot of people use them no problem, but what I constantly scold myself for is that it never came to my mind, I never asked myself, not once, why they would have me do it, instead of doing it themselves, if it wasn't illegal. Now, after I stopped receiving emails from them, and because I wasn't paid whatsoever, I realized that it is indeed a fake company. Anyways, I've learnt my lesson, I'm never going to go near an online job unless it's on a big trusted website like Upwork or Freelance. Be careful who you talk to online, not everyone is going to be genuine.",

They were looking for an Online Service Manager and my resume seemed to fit the bill.  I was a little concerned at first due to the lack of proofreading that seemed to go in to the email, there were plenty of small mistakes and improper grammar use.  I brushed it off at first because when I checked their website it seemed professional and legitimate and the opportunity was too good to pass up.  As I filled out different forms (each sent as quickly as I could fill out, also suspicious) my suspicions grew.  Then when I was accepted and was able to start my probation period (of 5 days) I was told by Darlene that I would need to set up a personal Bitcoin wallet and they would send me money through interact e-transfer to purchase the Bitcoin to fill my wallet to pay for the transactions I would be making on behalf of various businesses NAS partnered with.  When I expressed my concern to Darlene over email about the use of Bitcoin she called me, she sounded very foreign, could barely speak a lick of English.  She explained to me that I would be purchasing plumbing materials, construction materials, and other building supplies for their partners.  I told her thanks but no thanks and hung up.",

And, I found one that showed exact same email letter I received from Jessica Wilson:\nDear *******&nbsp;Our warehouse manager just informed me that we don't have laptops in our warehouse at the moment. They will receive new equipment after July 3th.\nStarting  from 2015 we buy office equipment with a 30% discount in our customer's online store only. They are receiving the payments on their \"Bitcoin\" wallet only, but our accountants are unable to make payments on the \"Bitcoin\" wallets at the moment.\nOur director just offered to our accountants to send the money to you for your office equipment (about $1500 CAD).\nAfter receiving the money from our accountants, you should pay $1500 CAD for your office equipment - send the money to the online store's \"Bitcoin\" wallet from any nearest \"Bitcoin\" ATM.\nAfter the payment you will receive your equipment in 1-2 days by express mail.\nYou may find the nearest \"Bitcoin\" ATM\" in Google.\nThere is not any transfer fee. You don't need to spend your own money for this!\nThe easiest way to send $1500 CAD to you is \"Interac e-Transfer\" system.\nHave you ever used \"Interac e-Transfer\"?\nBest regards,\nJessica Wilson, HR manager of \"Corporate Business Solutions\"\nWorking hours: 8:00 AM - 3:30 PM (EDT)\nHead offices:\nU.S.A: 200 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33132\nCanada: 275 Slater St, Ottawa, ON K1P5H9",

Questions included my full name as it appears on my ID, address, phone number, date of birth, where I do my banking. All correspondence was done via email at first.\nMy first assignment required me to deposit a check into my personal bank account and keep part of the funds as payment and the rest was to be used for my assignment. Specific instructions were promised to accompany the letter and cheque. However, upon receipt of said letter and cheque, instructions were then only to be given after depositing the funds in my personal account. This is when I really got nervous and decided to consult with my accountant for advice.\nHe cautioned me that the info I had shared with him led him to believe this to be a scam, a money laundering or fraudulent enterprise. I decided to trust him and my gut and so I have declined the position. I am still waiting for final correspondence in reaction to my refusal of the assignment and instructions for the return of the cheque.\nThe image I attached is of the initial email I received, asking if I would be interested in learning more about the opportunity. I have saved copies of all other correspondence, including the letter that accompanied the cheque.",

If so please respond with my full name and telephone number stating I am interested in a telephone interview. A few days later I received a phone call and telephone interview. A couple days after that I was sent another e-mail stating that I passed the interview and they were interested in hiring me. They said they wanted to send me a cheque by mail to buy supplies to help set up their new office. They asked for my full name, mailing address and telephone number so they could send me the cheque. I found this very suspicious so I googled the business name and address and nothing came up. So I came on here to do a search for scams and found many similar scenarios. I stopped communicating with them after this. I am guessing they would eventually ask for my S.I.N. or banking information to process my pay and try to rob me blind.

After all that we get to her office and she tells me that I have to pay a fee for the site, I told her I don&rsquo;t have any money to pay, then she just goes and pays for it with her card which I felt that was forced upon me cause I didn&rsquo;t ask her to pay for it or even want to join the site, then she tells me write down all my debt card information and expire date, which I did.Then she tells me to get a blank cheque from my bank and drops me off at the CIBC, so I go and ask for one, the lady at the bank gives me a weird look and asks why, I try to explain to her and she&rsquo;s still confused as to why I need a blank cheque. So I get picked back up and I told Jess what happened, then she&rsquo;s like thats ok you&rsquo;ll pay me cash, and I questioned her again why I need to pay this fee, she said it&rsquo;s for the training and for the site but before all this she told me the training was free. Then they expect me to walk around all day and recruit people the same way she did to me without getting paid cause apparently I&rsquo;m my own business, is what they kept saying to me when I asked how do I make money from this company. Then she finally tells me that I get the money back when I&rsquo;m done, so what&rsquo;s the point on paying for that if you get it back and why do you have to pay a fee for a company that supposely hiring you. Doesn&rsquo;t make sense. So I requested my money back and told her I don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;work&rdquo; for them anymore, but their holding my money and keep telling me to go to their office so they can explain to me but they already explained to me 4 times already and I keep hearing the same thing from them. I still don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ll make money from the company.All I know is They took $131.25  from me...I have to recruit people to get promoted without pay and they have my debt card information with expire date and my social insurance number.",

    "Description": "While looking for a job, I received an e-mail from Richard West at Capio Business Solutions Inc stating that they have a good salary and position waiting for me if I choose to e-mail them back and accept.  I asked questions which were not answered in their original e-mail and they sent me a copy of the job offer.  Included in the offer was the following:\n\"It is home based job. You will work from your home. Using your smartphone or laptop.\"\n\"Bank account for work: During the trial period you may need to use your personal bank account. Your account will only be used during the trial period, after passing it you will be provided with a company account.\"\nIt sounded like a fairly decent offer to work from home up until I read that I would be using my own devices and bank account.  They sent an e-mail directly and claimed to have found me on the job website ZipRecruiter, which I had been visiting daily.  The letter was well written and formal enough to sound real, so if you skim over your e-mails, you might miss important details.\nThey also sent a Labour Agreement which stated, among other things:\n\"5) Disability: In the event that the Employee cannot perform the duties because of illness or incapacity for a period of more than 1 week, the compensation otherwise due during said illness or incapacity will be reduced by 50% percent. The Employee's full compensation will be reinstated upon return to work. However, if the Employee is absent from work for any reason for a continuous period of over 1 month, the Company may terminate the Employee's employment, and the Company's obligations under this agreement will cease on that date.\"\nThis is not in accordance with the Human Rights Tribunal or Employment Standards Act.\nI did not continue the e-mail conversation, and their website has apparently been up since 2010 although, according to the Government of Canada, their business has only been active since February, 2017.\nAs you should never have to provide personal bank account information to your employer, I am asking you to look into their business.  Their business number is 825640055RC0001 and located at a residence in Newmarket, Ontario.",

You don't need to spend your own money for this!\nThe easiest way to send $1500 CAD to you is \"Interac e-Transfer\" system.\nHave you ever used \"Interac e-Transfer\"?\nOn the surface it does look a like a real opportunity, but when they final get to this above point in one weeks time, after what I now know is a wasted week.

    "Description": "I had been applying for tons of jobs, so when a company sent me an email requesting a phone interview, I didn't think anything of it.They explained that they were rooted in BC, but that they had purchased office space in Ontario and were going to be opening a location in Toronto. Before the interview though, they offered me a full time position with quite a decent salary considering the only experience needed was high school. They said they would start me on a two week probation period, which I told them I couldn't start until the following Monday because I had to make arrangements with my current job first, which they said was fine. The next day, they phoned me four times, all of which went unanswered because i was at work, followed by two emails telling me they required me to start the next day, as their CEO was planning to come down the next week to finalize the office rental agreement.\nAt this point I figured it had to be a scam of some sort, but decided to continue just to see what was going on.They sent me over an official looking contract which they had me fill out and sign, along with sending a picture of myself holding the signature. Now that brings us to my first day of training, in which they had me fill out a job posting and post it on an online board. That was simple enough. The next task was to post another job posting on an online board, except this time it was going to be paid. They explained that no money was to be coming out of my pocket, and that they'd transfer me the money in 2 or 3 installments so I could purchase bitcoin to post the job online.\nObviously as soon as they requested my banking information I emailed them back saying I was no longer in need of employment, and deleted the job they had me post. If the job offer seems too good to be true, it most likely is.",

I they were much more worked about me cashing this cheque then what I would be doing. They also did not have pre-arranged locations for me to go to.  This went against everything they said before.

    "Description": "This organization listed an opportunity for a stay-at-home writing position for a really good salary on Craigslist. After applying for the position, they sent an email asking me to complete an online application form for the job and to use a reference ID number that they sent in the email - which looked like an automated response.\nOnce you go to the website to complete the application it asks you for your social insurance number, all of your personal information, a photocopy of your drivers license and your drivers license number.\nWhen I saw this I looked the company up on google and found that there are a few different people saying that this company is a scam employment. Some said they were asked for money when they did an online webinar, and others stated that they were asked for money after completing an online interview.\nI filled out false information and waited to see what would happen. I received an email saying that the position I applied for had been filled. However, I had applied the first day the ad was posted on Craigslist, there were supposedly 14 open positions, and they had replied to me within 24 hours to set up an interview so that's pretty much impossible.\nNext, the email said that one of this HR staff's friends' had an open part-time position and I should text them. I didn't do that because I had no idea what would happen, but this seemed super sketchy. Definitely a great way for them to collect too much of your personal information/serious identity theft concerns.\ncheck out:\nhttps://www.scamadviser.com/is-gtacareers.ca-a-fake-site.html\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/718j0w/is_gtacareersca_a_job_scam/\nhttp://forums.redflagdeals.com/anyone-have-experience-gta-career-limited-1135929/\nFor examples of people talking about it being a scam.\nCraigslist ad is:\nhttps://toronto.craigslist.ca/tor/wri/d/writers-needed-now-both-ft-pt/6594167693.html",

Also, I am going to supervise the whole process of your\n&gt;&gt;&gt; work.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Becoming quite experienced, you will have to ordinarily manage 4-5\n&gt;&gt;&gt; clients at the same time.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; There is the payment processing algorithm:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. A client transfers money via Interac e-Transfer. We choose this\n&gt;&gt;&gt; method as of the highest security.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; All payments bear your fee of 5%. You will get your commission\n&gt;&gt;&gt; rewards\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for each transaction.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; For depositing funds, you will get a secret question and its\n&gt; answer.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; In\n&gt;&gt;&gt; order to deposit a processed transaction, you are entitled to apply\n&gt;&gt;&gt; online banking systems using them from any device (laptop / tablet\n&gt; /\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; smartphone).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Having finished depositing, you will be enabled to withdraw your\n&gt;&gt;&gt; funds through your bank office. We recommend you to avoid\n&gt;&gt;&gt; withdrawing\n&gt;&gt;&gt; money through ATMs as they usually have withdrawal limits\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ($250-$500),\n&gt;&gt;&gt; which may slow down the transaction processing.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Here, let me tell you how to process payments to our contractors\n&gt;&gt;&gt; quickly and securely. When accomplished the Step 2, please find the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; nearest Bitcoin ATM to process the transaction to our contractors'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Bitcoin account.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Why Bitcoin?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; We use Bitcoin due to several significant reasons:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Bitcoin is highly safe and secure. Among all online banking\n&gt;&gt;&gt; systems,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Bitcoin account shows the greatest security level.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Bitcoin operation processing is truly fast. Making bank\n&gt;&gt;&gt; transfers,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you generally have to have transactions pending for a few days -\n&gt;&gt;&gt; especially when you submit a check payment from another bank into\n&gt;&gt;&gt; yours,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and the bank holds funds for verification. International\n&gt;&gt;&gt; transactions\n&gt;&gt;&gt; are also a time problem. This way, Bitcoin is much more efficient.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Bitcoin fees are extremely low, and sometimes you may get no\n&gt;&gt;&gt; commission at all.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a) The closest Bitcoin ATM is here:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2500 Hurontario St\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Mississauga, ON L5B 1N4\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Canada\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (Bitcoin ATM is installed at Number 1 Convenience in Mississauga.)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b) Please be guided by this video for processing Bitcoin ATM\n&gt;&gt;&gt; operations:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRtrnNg_svA&amp;list=PLXx3C_EX8lSP9NjdbJKV4cu9CYR8gNb3y\n&gt;&gt;&gt; c) Open the QR-code attached to this message as an image. This is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; unique ID for your payment. Please save it to the media library of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; your\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cell phone in advance.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. The transaction shall be processed within no longer than 3\n&gt; hours.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Bitcoin rate is highly volatile related to CAD, USD and others.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, the transaction shall be accomplished within the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; abovementioned time period.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I am leaving for my scheduled meetups now, but I will check my\n&gt;&gt;&gt; e-mail a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bit later and immediately reply to all your questions.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you. Talk to you soon.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Enjoy your day.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Joshua Duley\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (Head of Operations)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Phone: (646) 583-0289\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Big Good Digital",

The whole email was worded oddly and there was a job description included that was also worded strangely and even said you don't need any qualifications to work for them but you will be paid a lot. I didn't reply and they sent a second follow up email which I also did not reply to. They have a good website but a Google search of their company name yields no results. They say they have been around in Canada since 2000 yet there is no mention of them online anywhere. They have multiple locations listed on their website but they aren't specific enough (such as the address of a strip mall but not the specific unit number). If you google the addresses they do not link back to Eternal Radiance Staffing Solutions (some appear to be available for leasing) and on street view there is no signage indicating they would be located there. Again, I can't say for sure that it's a scam (Ive never spoken to anyone from the \"company\") but things just aren't adding up!",

Multiple attempts to contact both companies via phone or email failed other then the link to the original email source. Traced the Total IT phone number to an address in New Mexico. Another reason i believe it to be a scam is that condition of employment was to create a bit coin account that they would have access to.",

    "Description": "Emailed a Job offer for Executive Assistant without so much as a telephone interview. Claimed to see my value off resume alone. Full time $27 to start and $34 after 30 day probabtion.   Requested a reply accepting offer to hiring@intercae.ca. Email gave a number to call for any questions, but the email was not closed with a persons name, rather \"Hr Department\" no personal information was requested at this time.\nWhen I called the number a woman stating her name was Jessica answered.  I asked her straight forwardly if this offer was legitimate.  She told me InterCAE is an organization that assists schools with exchange students.  She told me the Edmonton office was opening in May, they are looking for office space. She asked if I had replied to the email - I said I had I was then told that in the interim I would be starting by doing work via the internet, until the office is up and running. And that id get a call in the next 2-3 business days to sort everything out.\nThis whole thing felt funny to me.  If you GOOGLE InterCAE - they are non existent on the web.  The link for the website- takes you to a website that says \"under construction\" but gives the number from the email as a contact number.  I find this very hard to believe to be a legit organization now, as if schools were indeed using them, there would be some record of them somewhere.\nThey Claim to work with these \"VALUED PARTNERS\": Air Canada, Destination Canada,  And who they call \"Aboriginal Tourism Assocition of Canada\" but if you google that organization, you are directed to Indigenous Tourism Canada, which uses the same logo as on the valued partners portion of the InterCAE webpage.  So perhaps they are utilizing trademarks without consent as well.  NONE of these listed VALUED PARTNERS have any reference to INTER CAE on their websites.\nI am grateful I did some homework, but I was initially very excited to be offered such a \"too good to be true\" position.  I have been without work for 7 months and I  believe they were trying to take advantage of me at my most vulnerable.",

The one partner left out of province the other only tells me by text to be there at a certain time in the am and I did so waited at nearby coffee shop to unanswered text which finally got inserted the next Wednesday. And they proceeded to tell me that I was fired in which the didn't pay me on the spot made me wait until the 15 the and for both pays there was no deductions .the second pay was in the form of cash after taking a deduction off me of 25.00 a day so that was 150.00 in total and my wage was never solidified from the beginning.so basically there reason for letting me go was always late but they wouldn't let me in or they weren't there because I was waiting for them .and no show.then to top it all off my tool box was broken into and many items taken and others I wasn't able to recover because I was met with hostility over a argument bout these issues in text and that's what happened in my experience there .I've been in the trade of Autobody 30 yrs I've never been treated like that ever.",

I assumed probably he found it from the ad that I had posted there, but it was still confusing. Anyways, he was all like &ldquo;$400/assignment&rdquo; and obviously I got interested. But my boyfriend sensed it was a scam, but we played along anyways. The only information he asked for was my home address, my name and my age. So I&rsquo;m like businesses don&rsquo;t ask for age, they ask for date of birth. And the email was probably typed by a 10 year old because there was too many grammatical mistakes.\nAnyways, the response followed was from a different email address. And it had asked me to confirm my information before they tell me about my first task.\nI work as a Western Union agent at my work place so I know all about Western Union frauds. So when the first assignment arrived at my mailbox, there it was: a letter from the so-called &ldquo;Myster Evaluation Team&rdquo; and a &ldquo;cheque&rdquo; worth $2,950.00 CAD. The letter mentioned that I was supposed to cash the cheque at a bank, then keep $400 for myself, spend $25 at Walmart, and with the remaining balance, I was supposed to send $1200 each to 2 different people in Paris, who fyi have the same zip code, from 2 different western unions. And then I was supposed to send an evaluation to: evaluation-reportcenter@accountant.com. Like the letter has too many mistakes on it. The envelope that the letter came in had a postal stamp and the address and name was hand-written.\nJust thought I&rsquo;d let you know so that scammers like these people can stop harassing people.",

The ad claims you just have to write some short reviews to make some money. When I was \"hired\" I was sent money via Paypal (all transactions were done through PP) in chunks of $20 dollars then sent a link to a freelance gig on Fiverr.com and Tictail.com, one of the gigs I was repeatedly asked to buy was this one: https://tictail.com/virtualassistant/i-will-be-your-private-detective-spy and this one https://tictail.com/virtualassistant/fiverr-sales-formula, and some others from stores that are \"mysteriously\" offline now. They would send me enough money to purchase it, then I would leave a positive review, then they would send me $10 via Paypal. The names of the senders were random, never from the email of the person I was talking to. I did this for about a month or more, then suddenly all the payments that were send to me were being disputed by the sender. And I had no way of arguing really the dispute, so the it would close in their favor, they'd get their money back. Eventually the money got returned and now my Paypal account is in a negative balance and I can't even access it anymore. I've emailed \"James\", or whatever his name is as his typing leads me to believe English isn't his first language, repeatedly asking for the money back to at least return my PP account to good standing. And he says he'll pay me back but never does. I was scammed, and so were all the people sending the money to me. At least they got their money back.",

They have a website but i am still not sure what to think of this situation. They assigned me a project asking me to do a presentation about my city in pdf format. They also gave me a run down of clocking in and out expectations.. they said they are located in halifax NS and they are soon opening a location in my city which is exactly what the other individual stated when i read their forum in yahoo.

    "Description": "I was contacted because my resume was found through a job application site. They offered a high salary of 1340 (cad) a week, promising I would be paid weekly and I could work remotely. I googled them and google lists an address in Rexdale. Score, right? As I went through the process they offered me a legal-sounding contract, promised a 10 day trial period in which they would judge my work, and then wanted to e-transfer money to my bank account so that I could then put it in a Bitcoin wallet. A legitimate company is never going ask you to use your personal account for money transfers, and they could just as easily put the money in a Bitcoin wallet themselves.\nThe money transfer was the proof I needed that the company wasn't on the up-and-up but there were details beforehand that made me suspicious:\nThey sent detailed, well-written emails and had a nicely put together website that used a lot of words but wasn't clear about their services. None of the people listed as working at the company on their website were findable on social media which is strange and neither was the woman I was talking to. The date their company was founded when you look up their Corp. number (10522988) on can1business.com does not match with how long they say they have been in business on their website. On their website they listed articles that supposedly praised them as the top marketing firm in X year. I couldn't find those articles anywhere. Frankly, the benefits were too good to be true.",

    "Description": "I responded to a part time job ad on Kijiji and when the person (Douglas Webb) responded to me he explained that the job was to post sponsored job ads on the website indeed.ca.  He explained that the pay would be $***/week or $***/bi-weekly or $$*****/monthly and to let him know how I would like to be paid and that I had the option of money order or certified cheque.  He then explained they would provide me with an email address to create under yahoo, as I would need this address to register and create a login into the site indeed.ca.  He asked me to provide my name, mailing address, phone number for payment.  He said after creating this account with indeed.ca, he would send me a detailed directory needed for the posting, and that I would need to do these postings 2-3 times per week.  I asked if the pay had any deductions (tax), and if there would be a T4?  He replied that the tax was taken care of and that the money was all mine.  When I chose to be paid weekly by certified cheque, he then said they would be sending me a certified cheque in the amount of $*****.  He said they were sending me extra money as I needed to use this money to purchase Itune gift cards and that this money also included weekly pay.  He asked me to purchase the gift cards from a WalMart near me but to provide the address of the Wal Mart to him that I would be purchasing them from.  I tried to call the number provided under his name a few times, but got voicemail each time. I said I would prefer to speak to someone directly about all of this and wanted him to phone me.  I then asked further questions on email, like how much of this was to be spent on Itune cards, and how much was weekly pay, and mentioned that something seemed \"off\" about this being legitimate.  I said you are trusting me to send me $****?  How do you know I will do what you ask?\nThis was the latest email I got back from him (note the weekly wage changed to $***/week; and the posting site change to Kijiji and now he is asking me to purchase the ITunes cards before I receive payment, saying I will be compensated):\nThanks for getting back to us with the Wal Mart address as requested. Be rest assured this is 100% legit and you have no cause for alarm. Also You can get the Itunes cards purchased. You are just to purchase like $**** worth of itunes card and it is only for this time. You will be receiving your weekly wages of $*** steadily. We will let you know when to receive the payment and the instructions needed to process the prepaid card.While waiting for the payment to arrive, we would like you to post on kijiji. There will be a compensation for this as well. Let us know if this is OK by you so that we can send you the directory needed. We will await your reply asap in respect to this.\nI replied and said I would not be using any of my own money to purchase anything and said this felt like a scam to get me to purchase Itune gift cards (esp as he explains this $**** purchase was a one time purchase - of course it is!  Cause then I would realize it was a scam!).  I also pointed out to him that he changed the wage amount and posting site to Kijiji (from Indeed.ca).",

    "Description": "I was contacted sight-unseen with a 'job offer' by Alice Williams of Diamond Staffing Solutions Ltd. in Vancouver, BC looking for a full-time, and a part-time Human Resources Specialist to work in their new office opening in Edmonton, Alberta.  The e-mail said (among other things), \"We have studied your resume and came to the conclusion that you will suit for this role.\"  If you were to read my resume, you would know that I am not qualified for this position as I don't have the needed education for anything more than a clerical assistant in this particular field.  I will convert the job description they sent me to pdf, and attach it.  The salary being offered for the full-time position is $5000.00 per month, but the 10 day paid probation term only pays $700.00 total (which is below the minimum wage here in Alberta).  In all of the e-mails she uses grammatical errors common to non-native speakers.  My guess (having studied linguistics in school, and having a lot of exposure to immigrants having lived most of my life in Vancouver) is that she is from somewhere in SE Asia or from the Indian Sub-Continent.  The second e-mail followed the first very quickly (just over 2 hours later), and sounds more desperate for a quick reply.  The third asks me, \"If you want me to erase yours address from our mailing list, please let me know.\"  The fourth e-mail says, \"I am going to erase your name from the mailing list and remove your name from the list of job candidate.\"  I still have all four of the e-mails she sent me, and would be happy to forward them to you if desired.\nI suspect she must've posted a legitimate-looking job offer using a different (legitimate) company name on Linked In, which I applied to so that she could get my contact information.  I haven't used this contact information on indeed.ca, which I have used in the past, otherwise I'd wonder how she had come to have my new 'for job hunting only' e-mail address that I have only recently started using.  I had similar things happen in the past with indeed.ca.  The biggest difference is that Diamond Staffing Solutions has a website which features an address and telephone numbers, and it shows up on a web search.  The website almost looks legitimate, except for the poorly-executed logo.\nNeedless to say, I have not replied to any of her e-mails, so I don't know what information or anything else she would have asked of me.  As it stands, she has my first and last name, job search e-mail address, and possibly my cell number.\nIn any case, I'd appreciate your feedback, and any advice as to how to proceed.  I will definitely block her e-mail address in the near future unless you or legal authorities advise differently.\nPS:  The e-mail I will provide below is my personal e-mail, not my job search e-mail.",

The email provided the details of the position and asked if I was still interested in the job.  I replied yes, they sent me documents to complete to do a \"security check\".  They explained they are an international company for international exchange students and I would be helping to set the students up for accommodations and provide general office duties.  The list of duties provided sounded normal.  They stated the office in London, Ontario was not open yet, it was scheduled to open in March 2018.  I would be expected to work remotely (from home) until the office opened.  I accepted the position and singed the documents.  I was instructed to sign onto an app called Telegram.  This would ensure I my hours were tracked.  I started to work on Friday Feb 9th 2018, I received my first project.  I was to create a PowerPoint presentation about London, Ontario.  The due date was Thurs Feb 14, 2018 at 5pm.  I competed the project on time and was told it was really good and they were happy with my work. The next day I received a new project.  I was to research accommodations for undergrad students coming to London, Ontario and staying for the summer months.  The due date was for Friday Feb 16, 2018 at 5pm.  On Friday I received a telegram message asking me to setup payment for accommodations for a group of students coming to Halifax NS and then to Ontario next week.  At this point I was suspicious.  So I asked a whole bunch of questions as to why they couldn't pay through the company account or credit card and why would they ask a new person to be handling money.  After I started to ask questions, the person stopped talking on Telegram.  So I finished my project and handed it in at 4:40pm.  I was told we would be working on Family Day, so I signed into Telegram this morning and Doris Holinaty is not online.  So I called her number, it is disconnected, as is another number used to call me.",

    "Description": "I was contacted via email by a Bob Faust, he stated they got my email from Indeed. They stated the following:\n\"Good morning. Thank you we've got your resume on Job site Indeed.com.\nWe will review your resume during the day. Please reply on this email if you are still looking for a job, I will give you more information regarding the company and available position.\"\nAfter my reply stating i was looking for employment they gave me some more info. \" We conduct our operations and continue the development in the field of Human Resources.Recently, we have expanded our staff and we are planning to open new offices in 4 cities of Canada. We would like to offer you a position of Human Resource Specialist. We have studied your resume and came to the conclusion that you will suit for this role.\"\nThe company seem legit as they provided a website with information. They then proceed to offer me a contract that seem real in where i stupidly accepted and sign. (by the way they request a picture of ur face with the signature of the contract) . The next step was a phone \"Interview\" a lady name Kate called me, that was my first suspicion. Kate seem like she was reading a of a paper, i could barely understand her and she didn't really ask me anything but stated the job offering from the email and and said i was hired. She asked me to email Bob and send him a date and time to begin my \"probation/Training\" which would be a duration of 10 days.\nI later got an email From Bob Fauser stating the following:\n\"Our operator told me that you had interviewed.\nI am pleased to inform you that you have passed the most difficult stage of our employment.\nCongratulations! I'm very happy for you. I have always believed and knew that you will be in our team!\nAs the operator told me, you are a very intelligent and sensible person.\"\nI found it funny that the \"operator\" stated that as we were barely on the phone for 5 minutes and i did not really speak. I decided to continue as i did not want to be judgy. Bod, then gave me my first task (which seem legit) i had to create a Job Ad on indeed, all was good till then. I was actually happy and excited to be doing work like that and from home! Reality sank in when he gave me my second task. He stated that the company used Bitcoin and proceed to tell me the following:\n\"I'll give you one Bitcoin account of our company. And I'll teach you how to use it.\nOf course, you will need some Bitcoins. We will provide you with funds for this reason. I'll help you buy Bitcoins.\nWe need to be able to transfer money to you so that you can buy bitcoin for work.\nPopular methods of bank transfers:\n1. Transfer to a credit card by card number.\n2. Interac e-transfer.\"\nRed Flag! I was not comfortable and did not think it was legit to be using my bank account for work purposes especially on my first day of \"training\" I emailed Bod and stated i was not comfortable doing that and i did not want it to be a scam, he did not acknowledge that comment but simply stated that during my trail i had to use my bank account . I took a while to respond and twice he asked me if i was there and to keep in touch. I did some investigating and called the building where their office is supposed to be, according to their website and i was notified that they do not have an office there and they've had complaints about \"The Halifax Staffing Inc\" using their building address.\nI then proceeded to email Bod the Following: \"Unfortunately i won't be able to continue with the training. I apologize but i am not comfortable with this type of employment. Please remove me from your Database.\"\nThis was his reply: \"Ok, thank you.\"\nI am glad i did not provide my banking information however, i am upset they have my personal information and a picture. Hope they do not use it.  Be AWARE! Don't provide any personal information until you confirm they are a legit company. I hate people taking advantage of good people looking for employment.\nAttach you can see the Job description with incredible wages.",

    "Description": "It started with a job posting on Indeed by a company called Basinview Consulting for a Cashier position. Basinview Consulting then emailed me to obtain my contact information for further instructions and mentioned that the position was for their client, Dahlgren Software Consulting. They also sent me the position details written on a word document stating that the job is to convert money into crypto currency by withdrawing money and depositing it into a crypto currency ATM. At first I was in disbelief as the job paid $17/hr and home-based, but with new technology products coming out I didn&rsquo;t want to question it too soon. She sent me an application form, also on word document, that included me having to list only 2 references. She then forwarded my information to Dahlgren Software Consulting (Ashley Baumann), who sent me an email the next day to ask if they can make an introductory phone call. Upon speaking with Ashley, she welcomed me to the company and said that she will follow up with more emails regarding training and probationary period. I asked her what the training would entail, she told me to just wait for the email. I asked her to tell me more about the company, she told me that everything I needed to know was on the website. There was no information regarding their CEO, other employees, etc when I Googled the company. I also looked up the address from their website and when I clicked Street View, it showed a house. After the phone call, she sent me a form and email stating that the Probationary agreement should be filled and signed before training will be held. In the form, it asks for E-transfer information as well as Credit Card information, which no job has any business in asking for. I was therefore &ldquo;hired&rdquo; without any interview, without a credit check or a criminal check, which is what you&rsquo;d expect from a job where you are required to withdraw and deposit money that&rsquo;s outside of company grounds. No money was taken from me, I declined the position right after.",

    "Description": "This lady named Caroline Dias uses Indeed.ca to find resumes, and offers people bogus work at a huge rate of pay, plus many promises such as increases, benefits and bonuses. She claims in an introductory email that EEIntercultural Affairs is opening an office \"in your city\" and is populating it with staff ahead of time. The opportunity is work-from-home at first. Duties are to create PowerPoint presentations about the area to ostensibly  be shown to foreign students. There is no face-to-face interview or meeting with anyone. I got the job in 3 days, and my references were not called. I investigated her phone number which GPS'd to Vancouver, not Winnipeg. When I pressed for executive tier and revenue  stream information, she didn't answer my Telegram texts and claimed their\ninternet connection went down. After more digging, I found out from BBB that this is a scam before she tried to launder money through me. Her trick is to e-transfer $3000 to your email address that you are asked to take to a local contact of her choosing, less $100 for your expenses. Then she calls  your bank and tells them you tried to scam her, which will cause your bank to place a hold on your account. I found out about her before she  got that far, and all I lost was a week's pay from my former situation. You should always be wary if there is no interview, and requests for banking information. Stay clear of CAROLINE DIAS AND EE INTERCULTURAL AFFAIRS.",

    "Description": "I applied on job ad on indeed as customer service manager.\nSome one called me from New York called Arlie (business development manager) but I couldn&rsquo;t pick up the phone. So he sent me an email (came to my junk ) that I am accepted and I have to sign the job offer and payroll form which was asking for email to send money by e transfer.\nI did that and send them back to him .\nThe day after, I received an email from my supposed manager (James Evans) that I have to be the person who will contact customers and contractors to deposit money from them and pay money to others using my bank account. I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable with that and send them that NO and I declined the job .\nHere&rsquo;s the email content:\nThere is the payment processing algorithm:\n1. A client transfers money via Interac e-Transfer. We choose this method as of the highest security.\nAll payments bear your fee of 5%. You will get your commission rewards for each transaction.\nFor depositing funds, you will get a secret question and its answer. In order to deposit a processed transaction, you are entitled to apply online banking systems using them from any device (laptop / tablet / smartphone).\n2. Having finished depositing, you will be enabled to withdraw your funds through your bank office. We recommend you to avoid withdrawing money through ATMs as they usually have withdrawal limits ($250-$500), which may slow down the transaction processing.\n3. Here, let me tell you how to process payments to our contractors quickly and securely. When accomplished the Step 2, please find the nearest Bitcoin ATM to process the transaction to our contractors' Bitcoin account.\nWhy Bitcoin?\nWe use Bitcoin due to several significant reasons:\n1. Bitcoin is highly safe and secure. Among all online banking systems, Bitcoin account shows the greatest security level.\n2. Bitcoin operation processing is truly fast. Making bank transfers, you generally have to have transactions pending for a few days - especially when you submit a check payment from another bank into yours, and the bank holds funds for verification. International transactions are also a time problem. This way, Bitcoin is much more efficient.\n3. Bitcoin fees are extremely low, and sometimes you may get no commission at all.\na) The closest Bitcoin ATM is here:\n216 Saddletowne Cir NE\nCalgary, AB T3J 0C9\nCanada\n(Bitcoin ATM is located at Jerry's Convenience Store in Calgary.)\nb) Please be guided by this video for processing Bitcoin ATM operations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9-xP2CBWj0\nc) Open the QR-code attached to this message as an image. This is the unique ID for your payment. Please save it to the media library of your cell phone in advance.\n4. The transaction shall be processed within no longer than 3 hours. Bitcoin rate is highly volatile related to CAD, USD and others. Therefore, the transaction shall be accomplished within the abovementioned time period.",

I can't believe I was stupid enough to fall for this, except it makes perfect sense and you can actually make money from it...if you're willing to scam other people into plugging their money into the system..the people above limitless family are called unstoppable family and the people above that, well, now you're getting into the big smooth talkers..  empower network..etc.. so what happens is, you put in some money, and obviously, the more you put in, the more 'money making secrets' they 'unlock' for you so i went whole hog, put in $5000 up front..you have to spend money to make money right??  and they give you the basics, which is that you have to get the maximum number of people to even look at your spiel to get the minimum number to even sign up...it's really hard to get people to look at your stuff, you have to have a hook...but you can buy these packages where these other, sideline companies, get tons of eyes on your stuff, but it's expensive and it doesn't always work... example, you might spend $300 for 300 'guaranteed' eyes on your site and MAYBE one of those people sign up... then, you can also buy 'super great tips' from someone else in the business but they're selling their 'tips' to everyone so we're all doing the same thing and no one is winning, except for the guys at the top..  and they'll tell you that technically they're not a pyramid scheme because they technically have a product for sale(some ridiculous e-books on marketing) but the product is just more vague blather about nothing and just them saying a lot of words to pump you up about making sales but not really telling you how to do anything. They send you emails constantly, showing them living their fabulous lifestyles but the truth is, they move to countries like indonesia because it's cheaper to live down there and there's probably some legal/illegal reasons too but i don't know those.  If you make 1 sale, you get excited and think that's the beginning of something big so you hang in there and spend more and more money, but if you're not a bullshitter, you won't succeed.  i spent $20000 trying to start an above board online business so i could spend more time with my family, my aging parents...etc.  Instead of succeeding, i now have a second and third job to pay off my debt, because it wasn't above board, it's scammy and people can smell that from a mile away and don't want to sign up.   My mom died while I was working to pay off all this extra debt and I spent less time with her instead of more.  These people are dirtbags.  And they tell you straight out in their videos(the guys at the top), that they've been shut down before and they just keep starting up again because 'THE MAN CAN'T KEEP US DOWN!'  Am i angry and bitter that it didn't work for me?  of course i am.  would i still be doing it if it had worked?  i don't know, maybe.  i won't lie, if it had worked i wouldn't be listening to the people who told me this was a scam from the beginning.. but it didn't work and i was finally honest with myself.\r\ncheck out http://homebusiness2-0.com/rhonda_swan_and_brian_swan_unstoppable_family_review_of_jmap_properties.php\r\nit's an article another scam artist wrote but it includes big names in the whole internet scamming business",

I then asked him why would a company use a customer new employees is bank account to accept payments from its customers if this company was so reputable he's replied by saying that they would provide me with a corporate bank account after two weeks of the trial period.

I went through the process believing that it may be a genuine offer and was offered the position.  I was sent an employment contract that I did not sign as there are some very suspicious paragraphs and requirements.  The pay seems far to much and they want me to create my own email account.  They class Canada as a state and the rules of employment does not reflect the employment laws of Ontario.  I asked for a personal meeting to discuss the contract but have had no reply since that was requested therefore I believe this is a scam to eventually gain access to personal information.",

    "Description": "Stupid me fell for this scam . The lady said I would be paid a lot of money per hour to work from home (until the office opened in \"my city\" next month. I worked a couple of days and the day after Christmas the lady I had been communicating with said she had a \"special assignment\" for me. She said I had to make a payment to the hostel that students would be staying at when they came to visit Calgary. She said their \"company vendor\" would be sending me $3000 via e-transfer and I would have to go and pay the hostel $2900 because I could keep $100 for \"gas and lunch\".  When I refused to go to the coffee shop address she gave me, I asked for an email address to send the funds back to. She gave me caroline.d@eiaffairs.com I told her that I was keeping what was owed to me for the hours I had worked and would send back $2450. She didn't like that but I did it anyway. Then I had a hold on my account because someone had claimed that I had fraudulently transferred money which is completely backwards. Luckily my bank knew I was being honest and released the hold. Please do not be as silly and gullible as I was, if you get an email from this company saying they are a student exchange program and you got an amazing (sounding) job DO NOT RESPOND! they are evil criminals.",

    "Description": "I was initially contacted by a woman who called herself Caroline Dias, the email stated that the HR Dept. Reviewed my resume and wanted to offer me a position as Administrative Assistant. She said the office was in Winnipeg but they were opening an office \"in your city\" next month. They said I would be paid $27/hour and after 4 week probation it would be $32/hour. Looked kind of legit but I had my doubts since they did not want to interview me. That night , my fiance and I attempted to find this \"company\" online but couldn't find anything. The next day they emailed again but now there was a website listed as well. I stupidly accepted the position and she wanted me to work from home making power point presentations to describe Calgary . They were apparently a student exchange company and I was to create presentations to talk about the perks of living in Calgary. Then I asked if I could get paid for the days I had worked because it was xmas and I was broke. She said no the first time because the accountant was off that day. The following Monday I asked again about being paid, she responded by giving me a \"special assignment\" which was to receive an e-transfer for $3000 to pay for the hostel where students would be staying when they arrived to canada the following week. I accepted but had a bad feeling so I kept what was owed to me for pay and sent her back the rest of the funds. I told her that I wasn't comfortable and suspected criminal activity. She simply said *ok thank you\" and I blocked her and deleted the telegram App that she asked me to download to communicate with her from. Thank goodness I didnt lose any money but I didn't want to be involved in a money laundering scam which I'm sure it was. I was just the middle man so they didn't get their hands dirty. Beware of this company everyone. How mean of people to do to honest people looking for work. ??",

They also said that they were opening a headquarters in \"My city\" avoiding to state my actual city of residence; in the next month or so.\nWhen I called them asking questions, the woman that answered was very vague with her answers. Even when I called her right after she sent me that email, she didn't seem to recall who I was; she didn't recognize my name.\nShe sent an attachment of the job offer and asked for a confirmation either accepting or declining the offer, but also to provide my email and phone number. Which is strange because I thought she would have my resume if she's giving me a job offer.\nA day later, I get another email and this time it has two attachments: employment registration and employment agreement; which seemed legitimate enough. Unfortunately for them, that wasn't enough for me. I wanted to research the company, follow any clues they gave me that verified that their company existed. All I had was their website, it also looks legit but the: reviews, contacts, terms &amp; conditions and Privacy Policies didn't make sense. They stated they're affiliated with the Government of Canada and Educational System, why is there no evidence of affiliations showing?\nWhen I called the \"company\", the same number is the on the website and the email she gave me, she stated, \"that the company website is being updated and that everything about them should show up in a few days.\" Can you believe that? SHE TOLD ME TO CHECK UP ON THEM IN A FEW DAYS, then you'll find them everywhere on any search engine.\nAnyways, I asked her to provide the documents she has on my myself since she's giving me the job offer and I haven't heard back, I dont expect to hear back but I plan to report this anyways.",

    "Description": "I have received emails the last three mornings from Hartley Hunt Recruitment Agency, supposably out of Vancouver. They say they found my resume online (may be true as I have put it on a couple of the job websites such as Glass door and Indeed) and that they want to high me right away, sight unseen, for a part time (25 hrs a week) position at $1100/wk. Working from home. Or $5000 a month for working in the office.\nI&rsquo;ve googled the name, it doesn&rsquo;t come up. I&rsquo;ve searched the Better Business Bureau of BC, not finding it. I found a list of companies who renewed their business licenses in Vancouver on line, it&rsquo;s not there. Canada411 has nothing on it except that the number is provided by Fibernet.\nI was able to take the email address and using the last part find a very professional looking website hheagency.ca online that gave me a business address. 400, 602 W Hastings St in Vancouver. So I googled that. That address takes me to Reliance Properties and it says the suite is available in May. I then emailed the property manager asking if Hartley Hunt was a tenant in that suite. Received an email back about an hour or so later saying that the suite was currently under construction and that no one under that name had been a tenant.\nI have been sent a contract, that I haven&rsquo;t filled out, haven&rsquo;t sent any information. The contract itself has some very odd wording in it. I&rsquo;ve asked to meet with a representative face to face, been told that happens after the 10 day intern/probation period. Asked where the office is in Calgary, no answer to that.\nThere is just no presence for this company and I feel that someone that hasn&rsquo;t been diligent in their research may be taken advantage of by this company.",

My resume is posted on BCjobs.ca as well as Indeed. I was recently approached (did not apply for position) by 3Dlabs via email asking if I&rsquo;d be interested in the admin post for, the soon to be opened, Surrey location. They  specified that I was not to call the Company but was to respond via email, which I did.\r\nUpon checking on the business, using the web site provided, I found very little information so I then tried through Google. The only thing I can find is that it is/was an engineering (semiconductors) company that was taken over by an American entity.\r\nLast week I got another email, early in the morning, that said &lsquo;someone from our office will be contacting you soon to discuss the position, please ensure you are available for the call&rsquo;. This very unprofessional communication (no date or time given) coupled with the lack of Company information made me wonder if this was a legitimate offer. Then I got a call, on the same day, from the number listed below asking only to describe myself in 3 words and asking if I was still interested in the position. The woman did not answer my questions about the Company; said she&rsquo;d have another staff member respond to them. Canada 411 shows the 902 number under another business name and, upon checking the web site number for THAT company, I call and was told that 902-704-1570 was a number they had disconnected several years ago.\r\nI&rsquo;ve not heard a word until I received the below captioned email this afternoon. After many years in finance I&rsquo;ve learnt to proceed with caution when my &lsquo;gut feelings&rsquo; are yelling &lsquo;scam&rsquo; and this supposed offer (where I&rsquo;m told that monies will be sent to me to arrange accommodations etc, when I&rsquo;ve not yet met anyone from the Company) is also beginning to suggest a money laundering/transfer issue.\r\nDue to the reasons listed above I am reaching out to  the Better Business Bureau 1) to find out if this is a legitimate company opening a new office in the area and 2) to allow you to notify the appropriate authorities (or let me know who I should contact) if there are issues.\r\nI thank you for your time, XXX",

I couldn't remember applying for anything with this company so I checked the company website. It is a fancy looking website but the English is poor and there is no real information about what they do except for the logistics involved with moving. The position was to be the liaison between customers and the company for payment options. It was a work-from-home position paying $26.00/hr, which seemed too good to be true. It was not listed on their website. The positions that were listed each had the same thumbnail picture attached to them even though the positions were vastly different from each other. The HR rep who emailed me asked me to fill out an application form and gave me a very vague job description document. I filled this out and within the day they offered me the position, without asking for a copy of my resume, background check, or references. I was emailed a direct deposit form and a labour agreement document, and told to fill these out and send them back to the company, after which I would undergo a phone interview. The HR rep was very pushy, emailing me daily to ask if I had received the email and that they were waiting for my reply. I googled the address the company is supposedly located at, and found that it is located in a suburb in Windsor, not an industrial sector. The company is also not listed on the BBB.\nvia sendgrid.net",

I was contacted by a person (Michael Cole) claiming to be HR, he said that they received my application for the Staff Quality Evaluator Position being offered on indeed. I was told that I had been selected and that if I was interested to provide them with my age, sex, address, phone and current employer. I was told I'd be given $300 for each assignment I completed (secret shopper) Plus $100 for expenses.\nI emailed back and forth with \"mr. Cole\" and spoke with him on the phone ( I thought it strange that the person in Nova Scotia would have a thick indian accent, as rural Nova Scotia is not overly multicultural)\nI did receive a package by UPS with my assignment and a cheque for $3,800 which I was to deposit in scotiabank and verify that they adhered to banking standards of making 80% available immediately. (which I also found to be unlikely, as Canadian banks are only required to make $100 available.\nI did deposit the cheque and withdrew $100. I later received a notice from my bank that my account was overdrawn, and when I called them I learned that the cheque was a forgery.\nI am not sure how the scammers planned to make money from this, except maybe they were going to contact me and request the balance of the money back, (it never got that far.) I should have noticed the small discrepancies.

I agreed, so they said to wait for phone interview, but only call I got was about when can I start working.\nI did give them my direct deposit info and signed a contract which was not with a company but with a person recruiting me.\nAfter that \"employer\" asked me to download app Telegram for further communication. There she eagerly gave me full description of the business and future training.\nTurns out, that I was suppose to learn Bitcoin transfers and account handling. They wanted me to learn to deposit and transfer funds using my banking account first and then they said they going to set up with their account latter.\nI asked them some time to think. I started doing my research whether it was a scar. (I did some research prior to \"phone interview \" and didnt find anything scam related to the EXACAM CNC CORP. The only thing that was off is that I found their business licence in Canada but not in USA even though they had office in USA.\nDuring the weekends, me and my friend did further research. We found very limiting information regarding the company and only mention was couple jobs postings in Calgary where they dont have an office. Further on, person that contacted me and director of the company didnt have EXACAM CNC CORP listed in their Linked in profiles.\nLast fact that convinced me that I was being scam was that Person that contacted me through email and on Telegram app used someones other profile picture which we tracked with google images. In my mind, no trustworthy person would use someones else picture to hide behind.\nAfter that I blocked the app and stopped answering the phone.\nPretty sure it was Bitcoin money laundering scam where they would use my bank account to launder money.\nBe careful everyone.

I found it was questionable when 'Samuel' never gave me the name or full phone number so I checked their website and went on Google to find an office, only to discover there is no business office in Ottawa nor a 'Samuel Carter' on the employee list. Furthermore, I asked him to provide me an address and telephone number in which he never responded.

    "Description": "<p>I applied for a job through indeed.ca, even thought there was a glaring mistake in the job ad. It was posted as from BCAA (British Columbia Automotive Association) however the body of the job advertisement was written as from a recruiter looking for to fill their clients opening for a not-for-profit youth organization. </p>\n<p>I just thought it was a typo and applied anyway. The next day I got an email from Annette Bagwell saying that they were a job recruitment agency, that they were eager to hire me and to reply to the email if I still wanted the job. When I replied saying yes that did want the job I instantly got back an email to look over the attached job description. This is where I knew something was not right. The job description was not what I applied for however if was a work from home position with incredible pay. After reading it I was instructed to reply again to the email as to how I was a good fit for the job etc. At this point I decided to research this company. The website looks legit but when you try to look a little further on the site, especially the job search portion you get \"error\" messages. By searching the BBB I found another person who had a similar experience however she actually applied for the job and thought they were just trying to get her personal information.</p>",

I have my business (graphic design) email posted on many job and freelancing websites, so I'm assuming this is how they got a hold of my email.\nSo, I said \"okay, I'll bite.\" I could have totally used the job he was describing: remote graphic design opportunity, pay was good, health benefits, etc. I sent the link to my portfolio, I then get an email from a Ben Rivers claiming to be from the human resources department at DEIS, saying I have been shortlisted for an interview via Google Hangout (first red light; who interviews via text chat?). I get the link for the chat (deisonlineoffice2017@gmail.com; all of the emails are Gmail, also a red light), with the interview code Designs4Deis2017.\nOkay, cool. This is new.\nWe went through the WHOLE interview. Question after question. This part seemed very legitimate.\nIt got weird when he said that he was going to send a check via PDF (I know right?) for a mobile deposit, and needed my information (name, address, license, everything). This was the breaking point for me. So I asked if he could verify that he did in fact represent DEIS; he responded with \"We can call\". I then asked if there was a number that I, myself could call to verify, and if he had an employee number that I can refer to when I do call to verify. I was then blocked!\nAll of the emails used are:\n- deisonlineoffice2017@gmail.com (Jerome Silverspoon)\n- deiscareers.ggle2017@gmail.com (Ben Rivers)\n- sasjobs2017@gmail.com (Dexter Jackson)",

Nothing on my resume indicates that I would be a suitable candidate for a management position, especially in technology!

In addition, the letter states I just need to reply to the email to start employment, as well as a request to respond even if not interested. There are quite a few typos in this job offer letter as well.\nThere is a company named Complete TECHNOLOGY Solutions that I found on a google search, and a website for Complete TECHNICAL Solutions is apparently under construction. There are a few mentions of this name on yelp, Yellow Pages, etc., but I didn't see any actual reviews. The email address I was to respond to is career@completetechnical.ca. I was able to find legitimate email addresses for @completetech.ca only. You can also see in the attached email that the phone number is not written in the sequence that's used in North America (226)458-81-66. I googled Crystal Coates HR Manager, Complete Technical Solutions and a linked-in account for someone with the same name, who does work in the Human Resources/Recruiter field and presently at Staples, popped up.\nI did not respond so have no idea if there would have been an attempt to ask for money, or what the end game would be.

I was in a class during the time they called and tried to call back but no one answered.  After answering interview questions over email, the hiring manager answered me to inform me that I had been selected to work as an administrative assistant for their new company opening in Vancouver.  He told me that their accounting team would be mailing me a cheque for office supplies and I was to contact them \"as soon as the money was credited to my account\" and asked me to send him a copy of the deposit slip, which I did.  I was very naive and didn't consider that it was a scam!  Thankfully, my bank manager called me early the next day to inform me that the cheque was a scam and that I should contact VPD immediately.  Thanks to my bank, they caught it in time and I wasn't shorted money, and the scammer wasn't given any.  For the next three days I had panic attacks and nausea- it was a really upsetting experience for me.  I'm not very hesitant to use sites like Craigslist for job seeking.  I suggest to everyone else to try and go through free recruiting services.",

The minimum is one and maximum is\nthree.\nDo note that each task takes approximately two hours to complete.\nLuke Anderson\n16-08-2017\nHuman Resource Manager\n902-442-7615 EXT 103\nwww.astaffs.com\nAttachments area\nThis was my initial email.  It was followed up with several others, as well as 2 phone calls from different people.  I also had a phone interview.  As they were in Halifax and I am in Toronto I wouldn't meet anyone or maybe a skype Interview.   I was asked how many evaluations I would be able to take each week.  I was asked where I work, my full name, age, bank I used as they had to do a check because  I may be working with financial institutions.  I did provide all that information but never my account.  I was then called to tell everything went well and wanted to know when I could start. I called the number a couple of times and always received an automated system.  I then finally got a hold of Luke there and he said he would be sending the details of my first assignment.  I am attaching the cheque that was sent to me.  I was told I would be paid 300.00 for 2-hour assignments.  When I received a cheque from a plastics company which Luke claimed was a client I thought it strange.  I also, became suspicious as the check was for 4800,00 for expenses.  I realized that it was a scam and I would not deposit it into my account or contact astaffs again, I went to my bank and they verified that the check was fraudulent.  I also have other emails and the letter that was sent with the cheque.",

    "Description": "I was contacted by someone going by the name of Rebbeca Huff, on behalf of a job recruiting \"agency\" called Stainfield Jobs. This person told me that I'd applied and they wanted to offer me the job, but I had never heard of this company. Mind you, I'd been job hunting for months and was losing track of where I'd applied, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I couldn't find any information on the company; they seemed nonexistent (apart from their website that did in fact have job listings).\nThis person was very persistent, and despite me asking questions about what the job would entail, they gave me very little information about what my job duties would actually include. First my title would be Human Resource Specialist, then on the \"Freelance Agreement\" they sent me it said Job Recruiter. They didn't speak English very well which was odd, you'd think someone in their position at an actual agency would have decent grammar. And the salary they were offering was overly generous for very minimal, stay at home work. It didn't make sense.\nWhat fooled me was that contract. I read it over a handful of times, and it seemed legitimate. Looking back, they could've copy and pasted it from anywhere and had me sign it. But I was desperate after job hunting for so long, and was intrigued by the possibility of actually making decent money with minimal experience. My judgement went out the window.\nWhat has my stomach in knots now, is they also wanted photo ID. So I took a picture of my driver's license (I blurred out my license number and address) and sent it to them. They now have my full name, photo ID, date of birth and postal code. All basic private information to get into private accounts, and god knows what else.\nI **** **** * ******** *****, and regretted it as soon as I pressed send. I didn't do my homework until after the fact, and realized that every email interaction between myself and this so called \"Rebbeca Huff\" (whom I couldn't find on Facebook or social media) was a red flag, and a clear indicator of a job scam. Now my personal information is most likely in the hands of criminals.",

    "Description": "I was emailed a position about working with a company called SEA Achievement Program or also known as the student excellence achievement program. Not thinking, I thought this was a job offer I got from the numerous job ads I responded too through kijiji or indeed. Later on with working the job I noticed things weren't adding up. My job description was to work a 9AM - 5PM job making powerpoint presentations for foreign exchange students to know about Calgary before they visit. I was told to add a app called telegram in order to reach contact with the woman who gave me the job. The number she has provided is the same number on the company website. There came a specific day where I was asked to receive $2400 from an acclaimed sponsor that will pay for the students stay that are coming to Calgary. The students coming to Calgary were acclaimed to stay for a week and were coming from Germany. That confused me a bit as on the website, it said students were suppose to travel the world. Mostly Europe or America and mentioned nothing about Canada. I received the payment and was repeatedly called and messaged to be updated about what was going on with the funds. I was told to take out $2400 and deposit it else where. I failed to do so and was asked to e-transfer it back to her. 3 days later was supposedly my \"pay day\" from this company and the woman named Stefania Paolini stopped responding through the telegram app as well as my phone calls. I later had friends and my boyfriend look at the website and the details and I was blinded to see now that I was a victim of this fraudulent behaviour. To this present day, I have been emailed again now by a woman named Elizabeth Gilbert who has the same tactic that the previous woman used. The company she is representing is called stainfieldjobs.com. She is now asking for personal information such as pictures of drivers license, passport or medical cards that I think are resulting to identity theft. If she could be stopped as well that'd be great.",

The victim wanted to drop by at the scammer's office in downtown Toronto but the scammer changes the subject and directs it towards the \"so-called\" training. The victim sent a copy of her driver's license. The victim is already doubtful and decided to back out but the scammer already sent the first package to the victim's house.

That is the information that they will use to commit fraud crimes.\nA few other red flags were that the job application asked for age and gender, which a professional HR person would know is borderline illegal to ask on a job application. Also, the sentence and grammar structure was laid back and unprofessional. And finally, I noticed that the job acceptance form looked extremely similar to a form in a video about another logistics accompany job scam (specifically the blue stamp).",

He called the position Online Service Manager. I asked if we could chat on the phone regarding what the position entailed. He responded back on email stating he could only be contacted by email. His English was very poor and it all started to look like a scam. I googled the employer and found nothing. The only way to see a website on the employer was a direct link on the email I received. I finally searched the man's name on ********. He actually lives in ****. He claimed to be expanding his IT business to ******. I believe the entire job offer was a scam to hack in to my bank account. Shortly after I said I might be interested, a fake email came to me from my bank saying an attempt to access my account from an unknown source needed my attention. It asked me to enter my email and password to get into my online banking. The email was not from my bank but from this man. Always look up the employer, the company, etc. before accepting any offer of employment. The links in his email were all fake but did appear completely legitimate. BEWARE!!!",

    "Description": "I was contacted by email from a person by the name of Ashley Lawrence at AGRP Solutions Inc. stating they found my profile and resume on *********, which is an employment website.  The email was vague about what the job entailed, but I was curious as I am in search of employment, so I responded with the job application form they included, despite my concern about the Word document she sent me, which was not professional and contained too many grammatical errors.  I also had an electronic signature on it, that was illegible, but no name was printed, just a title.  The job application did not ask for any seriously personal info that they would not have already seen from the employment website ******, so I proceeded with the application.  I did conduct my own research, I *******&nbsp;the company which brought me to a very basic website, again not describing in detail what they do, there were no links, no terms of services, and the phone number that was not local or even a 1-800 number, it was strange.  I then *******&nbsp;the person who contacted me Ashley Lawrence, which I was unable to find anywhere, a ********&nbsp;profile, etc.  The address listed on the website for this \"business\" is also a residential apartment building.  I received another email from Ashley saying they are welcoming me to the position, I replied asking a few more questions about the job, the company location and if I could speak to Ashley on the phone or meet her in person.  I was told that she only corresponds via email, again the email was full of grammatical errors and not professional, like a business should be, she also did not answer any of my questions/concerns.  She sent me another Word document, which was a Contract for Employment, this one was just as full of grammatical errors, nor professional on any sort of company template, it also had a new name on the form which was Hooman Tobari.  I tried to find if this company was incorporated like they claimed and was unable to find anything on any of the government websites for incorporated (legal) companies.  The emails were vague, very sketchy and unwilling to answer my questions or speak on the phone.  I also researched their \"testimonials\" that were on the website and these people do not exist, except for one which is in Australia.  I have included the two Word documents (converted to PDF for uploading purposes here) that were sent to me.  It is also strange for a professional company to sent anyone Word documents, most companies will send PDF's, so they cannot be doctored, this was another red flag for me.  I have kept all the emails from this company.",

    "Description": "I was invited to an interview with Highmark by a Theresa Flowers through Upwork. She invited me to interview through Google Hangout. I contacted her and she asked me my email address to forward a \"job briefing\" to me and then conducted an interview with me for what I thought was data entry work at home with this company. she asked the usual interview questions, told me about the company, what the duties would be, and then asked for my ID to proceed with the next step in the interview process. I provided my ID. Then I was told that I was hired but had to purchase a $50 \"Steem Wallet Gift Card\" or itunes card because that would activate the time tracker if I was hired. I purchased a $50 itunes card then gave her the number. She immediately informed me the card was invalid. I had just purchased it so I knew it would be working. I said I would call itune support to find out. In the mean time she told me that it's probably because someone scammed it and I should return to the store to complain and get another card to proceed with interview. I said I couldn't afford it. She then asked if I had a credit card. I said no, she then asked what my bank info was. I replied that I wasn't comfortable giving that out. I asked if we could proceed without the card for now, she replied it would violate policy unless I have at least a $25 itunes card. She then informed me my chance of getting the job was now low because the company was looking for dedicated freelancers who would create an idea during emergency and that they would need to check my credit score since I don't have a credit card. I finished speaking with apple who informed me to make a police report because 30 minutes after I purchased the card, it was redeemed (which was the same time she was trying validate it). I informed her I was making a police report and she said that it was bullshit that I didn't call apple. I then informed her that I believe I was scammed and she asked what proof did I have. I didn't respond.\nI should have known better, I know that you NEVER have to give any money up front to get a job, but I didn't think itunes would also be a part of it. So If you have to spend or send money to get a job - it's a scam!",

Told via phone I was short-listed for interview and that I would receive a call. This duplicate call with the exact same scripted responses came twice from two different phone numbers. (Upon researching the phone numbers on google, they are provided by a third company party for remote clients who need a local phone number for a specified location). I never received an interview call, but an email telling me that they contacted me and I did not answer. (Lie: I have no record of this call.) I was asked to fill out interview questions via an email. I did so and then received days later an offer for a position paying 50.000/year. Huge red flag. Researching the photos from their website and their logo in Google image search revealed these are stock photos from other sites they simply right clicked and saved. Their business name is not registered in appropriate databases, no LinkedIn for the company or the \"hiring manager\". Their logo came from Deviant Art and belonged to a user who did not sell it to any company. Huge red flags. I replied for them to not contact me further and that I would let the authorities know. If any company seems too good to be true or the process seems too easy, research everything.",

    "Description": "North park education community is a scam (new one), and it is very likely that next time when they approach you, they will probably use a different method to fool you into giving them money in some shape of form. I'm just writing here in case you saw this post early enough to dodge that misfortune. The woman scammer is pretty stupid. Here is some detailed information about them:\nScamming since: March-April 2017.\nCompany name: North Park Education Community.\nWebsite: http://www.npecommunity.com/\nWebsites purchased from: http://www.namecheap.com, where you can own a website for $0.48/year.\nWeb-Analyzer that shows the company's TRUE information; http://wa-com.com/npecommunity.com\nNames that the scammers go by: Samantha Fenton, Fernando Villanueva.\nPhone numbers they use: Samantha:1-306-700-5597, Fernando: 1-306-229-5955. Toll Free number at 1-888-788-6393. The phone numbers appear to be from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, but the scammers actually route phone numbers to make them seem like the numbers came from Saskatchewan. The actual phone call is made from San Francisco, California in the United States.\nApps required to communicate with the scammer: Telegram\nwoman scammer's username:@samanthafNPEC\nFake Location: 1) 230 22nd St E. Ste 205 Saskatoon, SK S7K 0E8. 2) Piazza Fortebraccio 4, 2th floor Perugia, 06123 Italy  They claim their company is located inside a building. But as you can probably predict, the building exists, but their fake scam company doesn't exist.\nMethod they use: If you applied for a lot of jobs in Indeed.com, chances are, you might have applied for their scam company. They will contact you saying that they have read your resume and are interested in hiring you. They will explain that their office is located in Saskatoon, SK, but they are going to expand their office to your city, and they need admins as soon as possible. They claim that until they find a suitable office in your city next month, you will work at home. After you talk to them, they will send you a PDF file of job descriptions where they discuss the nature of the job,  high pay, benefits, bonuses, etc. If you accept the job, they will give you an Employment agreement form and Registration form where you will be required to fill out your name, address, education, and references and sign a bunch of agreements. Then she will tell you that the security check will take 1-2 business days. After 1-2 business days, she will contact you (phone call and/or email) saying you passed the security check, and that now you are on a probation with the company. She will ask you to download a mobile/PC app called \"Telegram\" which is a Russian app version of Hangout app. Then she gives you an Account Form, where you fill out your bank direct deposit information. From that day and after, she repeatedly assigns you projects which are easy but super time-consuming to complete and gives you 2-3 days to finish them. The nature of the projects is regarding your city, events, hotels, post secondary education, etc: Length varies but it is long.\nIf they didn't scam you earlier with all your personal information and bank information, they will try to scam you 1-2 weeks after.\nThis is as far as I got; As soon as I realized I was working for a scam company, I changed my bank information and put a fraud alert on my credit by contacting banks, TransUnion, and Equifax. The woman scammer tried to use my bank information and nothing went through. Then the woman scammer called me again for my bank information, and I gave the woman a computer virus and ****** up one of her computers. She pretended that nothing happened and asked for my bank information again(...? Yes, she is pretty dumb). I gave her another virus, which she didn't open and said the file was virus. Then she kept asking for my bank information, and I just trolled her. Now she blocked me from the Telegram App and her email address.",

    "Description": "I have been applying for jobs forever, through various streams such as Online Job Ads, Kijiji, Indeed Jobs and so on. Recently, I received an email from a name Todd Miller as \"Hiring Manager\" for Southgate Construction Co. Ltd, saying that my qualification and experience is favorable for a role in their new office that will open in Calgary downtown very soon. This is supposedly an ON company trying to expand in Calgary. There is no company address on his email but a link to their site. The site opens up and looks very legit as a construction company with full address, phone number, and details of what they do in construction industry. I have been instructed through email to either accept or decline the offer and if I accept, I will receive further instructions about next steps. No interview, no face to face meeting scheduled! By the way, there is a Word Document attachment with the initial email describing the job responsibility, salary per month and per year, vacation time. But at the end, they ask for full name and full address so that they can send me a cheque in order to buy some office supplies and furniture since it's just being opened. Not knowing, I did give my name and address and I received a cheque for way more than is needed for basic office supplies. I got surprised by the amount that I received but I was even more surprised to read a quick instruction that came with the cheque, asking me to deposit this big amount to an ATM machine only so that the funds are not being held at the bank and so that I can use it instantly. Banking system says opposite. depositing a big amount cheque from an unknown payor will be held for 3-5 business days in order to be verified. While being surprised still, I took the cheque to the counter and asked if I can deposit it to my account. That's when I found out that this is a scam. The teller did a great job of identifying it as scam and told me that she has to talk to her manager about it immediately. Soon enough, the manager came to me and asked me how I received the cheque. I explained and the manager confirmed it is part of a scam. However, to be certain the manager forwarded the letter and the cheque to their compliance department for more attestation.\r\nThe other red flag I found was the phone number. The phone number given in the email, on the Word Documents and the southgatecons.com website is actually from a Cash Store in Guelph Ontario. What does a construction company have to do with a Cash Store?",

    "Description": "I was hired by this guy to do masonry work for 20 dollars an hour. I worked for 2 weeks and never got paid a cent. He basically told me to take him to small claims court which would cost me more in the long run ..so basically I could screw myself. He cuts so many corners on the job and scams customers out of thousands, charging them for random extra work that he claims was necessary, yet he never even did. I've heard several guys complain about his pay ethics. He continues to go online and hire young men, getting them to work as much as he can before he ultimately rips them off. Knowing that they typically are students or low income young people who have no means to battle him in court over a few hundred dollars. He continues to operate this way as of this writing.",

The second email said that I would be on a 30 day paid probationary period after the documents they asked me to fill out were received and a background check completed. The previous email stated that due to the company working with students and government issued programs I needed to have a clean criminal record, but the was no documents sent for that check, none of the documents asked for my social insurance number, so I have no indication that they were planning to pay me. I called the number provided in the email to ask questions, the person who emailed me answered and when I asked about the documents sent to be filled out and said that there was some information missing, she said that I would complete new documents after the 30 day trial was over. The emails I had received stated that they were planning to open an office in my city next month and that was why they were offering me a job, I questioned that, but they did not know where in Calgary they were opening an office as they had not secured a lease yet. I was then directed to their website to find out more about the company, there was very little information. The social media links don't work and the twitter #'s do not link to the company. I did a reverse look-up for the Saskatchewan phone number on the site and all I could find is that it is a cell phone # in Saskatoon no other information could be found.",

I got an email from Samantha Fenton of NPE Community saying she is offering me the job without an interview and she responded to my indeed.ca application to Denver Winnelson. She emailed me a job offer for me to sign but there was no date next to the signatures and there was no start date mentioned in the offer. Their website claims they are a tenant of the Downtown Financial Building in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan with the address of: 230 22nd St E. Ste 205, Saskatoon, SK S7K0E8, Canada. When I contacted the building management for that building, they said they don't have a tenant with the name of North Park Education Community or NPE Community.

    "Description": "A lady named Patricia Tremblay contacted me by e-mail in my local language (french) with a job offer. The job is really well paid (30$/h) and is suppose to be payment management. They said they offer a formation and not to worry about learning the job because somebody will help me for that. I have absolutely no experience in business management or any education in finance. I gave them some already public information like my name, adress, references... They never contact my references and three days later they said i had the job, without an interview or any phone/skype talk. At this point, they ask me to fill a work contract and a form for direct deposing my salary in my bank (asking for social number and bank number). I was highly sceptical, so i try to phone Patricia and i had prepared some confusion question for her to answer and to see if she contradict herself. The phone number was not working, no answering machine, no ringing, the call just stop. So i was pretty confident in flagging them here on BBB.",

    "Description": "I was contacted by a Mr. \"Kevin Halstead\", saying he found my job online on the website Indeed. After sending me a number of forms to fill out, none of which asked about my abilities to complete the \"tasks\" that were supposedly going to pay me 67000 dollars a year. I was suspicious at first, however proceeded with caution until I was absolutely sure. Throughout the emails exchanged I noticed there were a number of grammar mistakes that were abnormal for a reputable company. I checked the website, it seemed \"legit\" however did not provide me with much more information about the company as everything was very vague. Finally, once I was \"accepted\" over many applicants (I did not even apply), I was told I would have a personal bitcoin account to handle business and would be sent an interact email transfer, and in order to do that I would have to give the account holders name (me), my bank institution, and my email address. This I immediately found strange because first of all, for interact transfers my name is not really necessary, nor is the name of where I bank. On top of that, they already had my email address? So I emailed Mr. Halstead back, replying that it seemed a little strange and I would like to speak to somebody over the phone. He replied back soon enough saying his manager would call me, but also saying welcome to the team... and he didn't really directly answer any of my questions which was also a red flag for me. Finally I received a phone call from the number listed on their website as their \"Markham, Ontario\" location. It was also the same number on \"Kevin Halstead's\" email stamp. However, the phone call was not from him, but from a lady who spoke poor english.  She began to describe to me exactly what the email had said when it was describing my tasks. She said that she was the \"iterator\" and that I would need to send another email if I requested more information about the legitimacy of the company. She said I could speak with a manager if I would like to, however the email said I would receive an email from the manager so I questioned her on that as well. She began to get nervous, and finally when I asked her what her name was she responded \"Tiffany\" and then proceeded to spell Tiffany for me. This lady on the phone had a thick accent and it was obvious to me her name was not Tiffany. When I asked her last name, she paused for a moment and then said \"Smith\". At this point it was hysterical and I began to laugh and say \"your name is not Tiffany!!\" and then she hung up.",

Before the interview was scheduled, the person posing as the HR Manager asked the candidate to submit answers to interview questions by email. The job seeker was advised they were advancing to the next round and asked to provide references and a date they would be able to begin employment. The references were never contacted, but the HR Manager then contacted the job seeker and advised them that they had gotten the job and an employment letter was to follow. The letter attached was received - clearly raising some red flags. An internet search revealed this scam has been previously perpetrated using other legitimate company names. The end game appears to be financial gain - the supposed position requires the employee to deposit company funds into their personal bank account. In other instances, the fraudulent employer has asked for some or all of the funds to be returned. Once the money is received by the scammer, the original check is cancelled, resulting in a personal loss for the employee.",

I followed up with their interview questions, all looked so professional until I tried to send my references yesterday as they requested and I got a failure notice and the company number after trying to call was out of service. It looked to me like a professional business growing in recycling cell phones and reselling in other countries while saving landfill waste. This is a scam company, they got my hopes really high and I worked hard on responding to their questions all to come back as a scam. I am so disappointing! It is hard to find a good decent job today' let alone having to live this situation. 'False hope'.. I hope they are stopped!!!",

I am looking for a job and my curriculum is on several job search sites and I am also with placement agencies to help me. The email mentions that they have seen my curriculum and they have the same position either part time or full time to offer me. Very well paid as well as commission on the work done and a work at home. I would take care of money transfers for their clients, either small or large companies; All by bank transfer. They sent me a PDF document for more details and another questionnaire to my effect, references that I filled out and returned by email. I received an email today congratulating me, my \"questionnaire\" has passed the pre-selection and I have been approved by the directors of the company. I now have to sign the employment contract as well as to fill out the bank form to be able to deposit my pay, 2 times a month. I did nothing of this. I am not called for an interview. They do not ask me to come to their office or anything. I just had the job like that ... I found it strange that the contract of employment was very badly written among other things and that I do not pass any interview and that I do not meet anyone for whom I would work ... too good for To be true ... I asked in my entourage and the majority say not to embark since it seems fraudulent. I did some research on Google for this company and apart from their website and the fact that they are registered at the federal level, there is not much. In addition, a Google Maps search gives me a building that does not bear the name of this company at all but another name. And a search with the name of the director has not been very useful except that this man is also the director of the company written on the building. So I will not fill out the contract or the other form. And I was advised to fill out a report with you.</p>",

I didn't particularly remember me applying to this location, but I was trying to find summer employment. Already email, there were countless syntax and grammatical errors, even in the quick reply emails there were these errors. After asking me some typical interview questions to respond to (which I did), they immediately asked for documentation for proof of my identity (to see if I wasn't a scam - how ironic) and fill out an employment agreement exploiting my personal information, excluding sin number. Again, more syntax and grammar errors in the agreement form. Looking at their website (moonstarfin.com), there are even more syntax and grammar errors. Looking at the about us management section, I see pictures of the supposed leaders of the company to which they don't even exist on LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter. I would assume the pictures of these people were fake because their visual ethnicity do not match their names or description of where they're from. They have a news section which in most company websites they are news related to the company. With this news section, they're just random NY Times articles that are completely irrelevant and have no connection to the company. In the contact us section, I try sending them a question to which I never got a reply back to. Then I tried calling the number provided - which is the same number of the emailed in their contact head, which they don't even have an extension number for either - and all I get is a dial-up dial tone.",

They got back to me a few days later, inviting me to an interview on google hangouts the next morning.\nThe interview itself seemed fine but after it was over, they said they had to go over my answers to proceed. After about 45 minutes, they told me I was hired and training would start the next day.\nThe next day, the person I was chatting with asked me two questions and answered two questions I had Amongst other things, they told me that while the company was American, they plan to open an office in Canada within 6 months. It took about 50 minutes all in all, because the person had to refer to specific departments in the company for answers. The day after that, we met online again, same time. He asked me to sign the employee contract he'd send me, which I did. I was now an 'official employee of Equian'. Note that he had so far not asked me for my social insurance number or bank information, other than which bank I am with.\nA day later, they told me they send me a cheque so I could buy some office supplies. Three days later the cheque arrived. As I was not home, I found it on my front step. It seemed kind of strange to me that they would send me money and then  not make me sign for receiving it. I opened the envelope and in it was a rather large cheque ($2,750). It seemed like a lot to me. I also noted that the company on the envelope wasn't Equian but Forever Green Intl. The company name on the cheque was yet another name: Dreamtec Global Inc. So I had three different company names for this one job I was supposed to have. As soon as I told the persons I got the cheque, he asked me how far away my bank is, where the nearest atm would be, how long it would take for the money to be deposited into my account. I got suspicious after I told him I could deposit it with online banking and he had to talk to the accounting department whether that was acceptible. At this point, I decided to go to the bank to make sure it was legit. My personal bank told me almost right away that it looked like a fraudulent cheque. They contacted the bank on the cheque to ask for information on the company that was on the cheque. As they were waiting to hear back, I went to the bank mentioned on the cheque. They said the bank didn't know they company and that I could either send the cheque back or rip it up.\nThe police (where we went after all this) informed us that we could make a report online, but that they wouldn't be able to do much, because that's just the nature of scammers. As soon as you're on to them, they change.",

Sent it back. Asked when I would start, because I have a job already and would need to give notice.\r\nHer response:\r\n\"I think that you can try this position.\r\nI have attached to this letter agreement for 10 days.\r\nYou have to:\r\n1.

I signed my name on it, and sent it back. After this \"Emilie\" stopped responding. I noticed that the signature at the bottom of the Labour Agreement was for \"John Krasner\", but the actual signature looked nothing like that, it looked like it started with an H and had an L in it. So I got suspicious and started researching the company. Googled the address, and a bunch of different companies all list 5700 Yonge St #200, North York ON M2M 4K2 as their address. For example: Yorkey-Investigations Inc., DocsBase Certified Translation Agency, ADR Mediation Network, Ease &amp; Strength Massage, Location of Life Pathways Psychotherapy, etc. and a lot more. I couldn't find anyone by the name of Emilie Burns or John Krasner that had anything to do with the company. The company has no social media pages. It seems to be owned by Seyed Ali Mirabolghasemi. The company website www.futurewebmedia.inc shows that they have another location in Australia. Locaton : 95 Murray st, Perth, WA 6001 Australia. I googled Future Web Media Inc. to see when/if it was registered and this came up, with an address that doesn't match:\r\n\"The Future Web Media Inc. was incorporated on Monday 17th May 2010, so the company age is six years and seven months. The company registration status is Active.Future Web Media Inc. register address is 7368 Yonge St., Suite#: 311, Thornhill (area code: L4J8H9) . The company's country of origin is CA. \"\r\nI figured it was a scam so I e-mailed \"Emilie\" and told her the address she gave me doesn't match the search results on google. She responded:\r\n\"It's our address.\r\nCongratulations! You have accepted for a trial period on the Online Service manager position.\r\nWe have chosen you out of a certain number of candidates for this position, and we hope that you will not let us down.\r\nYou are familiar with your responsibilities and ready to get to work.\r\nYou should check your e-mail constantly and respond to my messages quickly.\r\nJust keep your cell phone available to get a call from us at all times.\r\nMany organizations are required to produce accounting documents about their activity. Using Bitcoin allows you to offer\r\nthe highest level of transparency since you can provide information your members can use to verify your balances and transactions.\r\nBitcoin is an emerging market of new customers who are searching for ways to spend their bitcoins. Accepting them is a good way\r\nto get new customers and give your business some new visibility. Accepting a new payment method has often shown to be a clever\r\npractice for online businesses.\r\nTo start working with Bitcoin, you need to fill up your wallet. We will give you money via Interac system.\r\nTo do this, we need to know:\r\nYour Holder name:\r\nYour Bank branch name:\r\nYour Email address associated with account:\r\nYour phone number:\r\nThere is no fee to receive bitcoins, and many wallets let you control how large a fee to pay when spending.\r\nMost wallets have reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster confirmation of your transactions.\r\nFees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it's possible to send 100,000 bitcoins for the same fee it costs to send 1 bitcoin.\r\nAfter receiving electronic transfer, you will have to fill up your Bitcoin wallet. (DURING AN HOUR AND A HALF)\r\nWe will send you 2-3 transactions through Interac system.\r\nHave you ever used electronic transfer (Interac)?\r\nDo you have online banking active?\r\nYour duty will be to:\r\n- Contact the customer;\r\n- Take his order;\r\n- Analyze order;\r\n- Contact the seller (our partner);\r\n- Report the order value to the customer.\r\nAfter that you will contact with the customer and give him all the details of his order.\r\n(Including delivery time in client's region).\r\nYou must ensure all necessary tasks for the client. You should find an individual approach to each customer.\r\nYou should offer new services and products to him.\r\nIn other words, your position requires you to do everything possible, to make client happy.\r\nFor the future, he will work with us and recommend our company to others.\r\nYou need to understand your customer, how to do it:\r\nProviding a high level of customer care often requires you to find out what your customers want.\r\nOnce you have identified your most valuable customers or best potential customers,\r\nyou can target your highest levels of customer care towards them.\r\nYou should collect information about your customer.\r\nInformation about your customer and what he wants is available from many sources, including:\r\n- His order history\r\n- Records of their contacts with our business - phone calls, meetings and so on\r\n- Direct feedback - if you ask them, customers will usually tell you what they want\r\n- Changes in the overall success of specific products or services\r\n- Feedback about your existing range - what it does and does not do\r\n- Inquiries about possible new products or services\r\n- Feedback from your customers about things they buy from other businesses\r\n- Feedback and referrals from other, non-competitive suppliers.\r\nIt may sound hard, and sometimes it is not clear to you. Do not worry, I'll be in charge of\r\nyou throughout the 10 days. I will give detailed instructions step by step. So after the trial 10 days,\r\nyou will learn this profession, if you will work hard.\r\n!You should answer all the questions that I have written in this letter (highlighted in green).\r\nAfter that, I will send your personal Bitcoin wallet to you.\r\nIf you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask me. I will answer.\r\nThank you!\r\nEmilie Burns\r\nHR Manager\r\nFuture Web Media\r\n5700 Yonge St #200,\r\nNorth York ON M2M 4K2\r\nhr@futurewebmedia.net\r\nfuturewebmedia.net\r\n(647)-946-4277 \"\r\nOnce I saw that they wanted bank info, and to be transferring bitcoins around I knew 100% it was a scam and most likely money laundering so I decided to report it. I've attached the Labour Agreement I was sent. Notice how the signature doesn't match the name, and at the top in the greeting the words \"Future Web Media\" look pasted in. Hope all this helps!",

I've applied to many work-from-home jobs so I didn't think it was that weird that they found my resume on some site.\nThey sent me a contract to sign and (stupidly) included a picture of my driver's license. I actually went online before doing any of this and Googled \"Apikan HR + scam\" and found nothing. So I continued with the \"application\" and added a test job to Indeed.ca. Then they wanted me to use money they were going to send me to buy Bitcoins, which is where the big red flag came up as I didn't see how or why Bitcoins were needed to add jobs to job sites. This was about a week later, so I randomly decided to Google their name plus scam again, and this time I found some reports saying the same thing.\nThey're imitating a real company called Apikan Consulting in Quebec, even using the same street address.  The real company now has a warning on their site, apikan.ca, saying that any random emails from them is a scam.\nThey even texted me once asking me why haven't I done work yet from a number with a California area code: 442-226-4957. They were very pushy emailing me and calling me repeatedly if I didn't respond to their emails within 5 minutes.",

Car wrap advertising is the marketing practice of completely or partially covering a vehicle with an advertisement or livery, thus turning it into a mobile billboard. This can be achieved by simply painting the vehicle surface, but it is becoming more common and professional today to use large vinyl sheets as decals.  It can be removed with relative ease, making it much less expensive to change from one advertisement to another.\nVehicles with large, flat surfaces, such as Truck, SUV, and Sedan are easy to work with, though smaller cars with curved surfaces can also be wrapped in this manner. Wrap advertising is available to anybody irrespective of the vehicle you drive, mileage, make and model of your car .  You car mileage does not stop you from registering for this program. We are currently seeking to contract individuals in Canada and USA on how they would make extra cash by simply driving their cars wrapped with our company advert along the streets of Canada.\nLEARN HOW CAR ADVERTISEMENT PROGRAM WORKS:-\nIt is very important and imperative for you to get a better understanding about this program. Here's the basic premise of the &ldquo;pay to drive&rdquo; concept: We seek residents in Canada and USA, who drive while going about their daily lives activities with an advert from &ldquo;our Company&rdquo; plastered on their cars side door or rear glass. This advert size is relatively designed in different portions. The ads are typically vinyl decals material, also known as \"auto wraps,\" that almost seem to be painted on the vehicle, and covers a little portion of your car's exterior surface.\nPROGRAMM TIME FRAME:-\nAfter registration, processing and approval stage is done with and  the wrap has been installed, minimum duration is 20 weeks and maximum is 40 weeks.  If after the first 20 or 40 weeks you want to continue this program, we can re-register or reapprove you for another 20 or 40 weeks as you desire.\nTHINGS TO KNOW ABOUT DAMAGES:-\nNew technology age has brought lots of improvement in terms of research, production and installation process to lots of products. The decal wrap doesn't damage the paint of any car. We have the latest tech materials suitable with various kinds of our yearly weather.  This new tech will be installed and removed by our approved wrap expert once the contract is approved or when it expires.\nPROFESSIONAL INSTALLERS:-\nWe will not take chances with anyone or any local installer to do the wrapping as your vehicle is precious to us and we require a standard and attractive ad, so we will be responsible for installation and removal of the wrap to avoid any sort of damages to you vehicle but should anything occur we will fully be responsible for any damages.\nYou will be paid $325.00 per week which is essentially a &ldquo;rental&rdquo; payment for letting our company use the space and no fee of any sort is required from you. You will not be responsible for any payment or any out of pocket expenses. We shall provide experts that would handle the advert placing on your car. You will receive an upfront payment of $650.00 in form of a check via courier service or regular mail to cover your first and second week payment plus any other expenses if need be.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE:-\nWe will provide professionals strictly to come to your residence for installation and removal of the decal so as to avoid damage on your vehicle. Also you are NOT required to pay any fee from your own pocket. However, to enable us complete the registration process and approval, you are to provide us with the information below;\nFull Name:\nAddress:\nApt#:\nCITY:\nPROVINCE:\nPOSTAL CODE:\nAGE:\nMOBILE PHONE:\nHOME PHONE:\nEMAIL:\nOCCUPATION:\nPOSITION:\nNUMBER OF CARS:\nTYPE OF CAR(S):\nMODERN / YEAR:\nCAR COLOR:\nPRESENT MILEAGE:\nWRAP DURATION:\nNAME ON CAR REGISTRATION DOCUMENT:\nAttached is a sample of the car wrap for your review / perusal to enable you better understand how the ad might look on your car. Just FYI our company will fully be responsible for all expenditures and once the installation date is clear and setup you will be informed either by email or by phone. Thereafter, the date for your car wrap will be scheduled so the company can send their wrap specialist to your resident or office location for installation.\nFYI:\nYou are not required to pay any money from your pocket and you are not responsible for any cost or expenditure now and in the future. Our company is fully and only responsible for the wrap payment.\nI await your email with the requested information for processing and approval and installation appointment setup.\nSincerely,\nProject Coordinator\n(Prorecruiters Staffing)\nE:\nTel:\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, R3B 3K6\nClick here to Reply or Forward\n0.01 GB (0%) of 15 GB used\nManage\nTerms - Privacy\nLast account activity: 2 hours ago\nDetails",

Next thing i knew they were already starting my \"trial period\" and had me do the first task which was to withdraw money that they transferred to me and deposit it to a bitcoin atm. I thought okay it's their money so i thought there was no harm in doing the \"task.\" As i was doing it, i approached a lady working in the pub where the atm was to ask for help in using the atm since it was my first time. She asked me what it was for and i told her it was for my boss. She then told me that it seemed familiar and we ended up talking about it being a possible scam. She showed me emails she received from a different person and company but seemed like had the same modus. I had already deposited the whole amount in the atm and reported it back to my supposedly boss. He said he was gonna send me my next task but i havent receive any email from them yet. I dont know what to do im desperately seeking for a job and i think that i fell into an employment scam because of that. Im attaching a screenshot of one of the emails i received.

I was told I would have to make my way to Toronto for 2 day training (approx $1500 expense to me). Before committing to this, I asked about the territory I would have and about how they determined it was a viable area for a new magazine. I asked for contact information for other publishers in NS, or in Canada to discuss the opportunity in detail. They said they were going to get back to me with some real tangibles (territory, other publishers, etc),  but now have stopped communicating with me. I am concerned that they will get people to training, do a \"pitch\" and in the end offer no real \"employment\". It is a business venture at best - only viable for larger centers (20,000 people or more), but they are soliciting for people to start up in really small towns and villages (2,000-4,000). People are getting mislead, potentially ripped off..",

The addresses indicated do not have unit #'s either despite the building indicated at the address having multiple units. \"Tina Williams\" the \"HR manager\", does not provide any phone number with her email signatures.\nAfter doing a fake Skype interview where \"Tina Williams\" claims that she's having technical difficulties and cannot do the video interview until IT sorts it out. During the chats on Skype it is very apparent that \"she\" is using auto-type using a certain script. Despite not having an interview they still \"offer\" you a high-paying job without describing what it is exactly, and will demand that you use their equipment. She will then claim that they cannot transfer the money from Canada and that they will have to forward you the money, some $1500, so that you have to send the money through your bank via Western Union to Prague, Czech Republic. Again, no explanation is provided, the \"company\" is seemingly trusting you with a large sum of money to send to Europe to get \"office equipment\" 2 days later. Basically you act as a fake cheque mule.\nI can provide the emails sent to me by the scammer if you wish, in order to provide you with more detail.\nAlso note that the Canadian address they use is the following:\n170 Water Street North, Cambridge, ON, N1R 3B6",

I fiilled-up the form and sent back to her. She said, Mr. Thomas Winter (their Development Manager of The North America's department) will contact me within a couple of days if they find me suitable for the position (Alternative Investment's Support). Then this afternoon, I received an email from Mr. Winter (thomaswinter@mtycinvestment.ca), saying he is considering me for the said position. He sent a PDF file (Training Agreement-which now I need to provide my Bank details, please see attachment for more details).",

    "Description": "I initially received an email about my resume being found on a job website and offered me a job as a shop inspector or mystery shopper. I said I was interested in the job and got a call asking simple questions including if I had been employed before. After the call, I got another email with a contract I had to fill out and send back and that I had two days to comply or else they wouldn't hire me as an employee. They called each job a \"task\" and said before I would be payed I had to complete a test task. The test task was to visit a Bitcoin ATM and check to see if it worked, what condition the machine was in, and if there were instructions on how to use it. I sent back my report on the machine and was told that I would start work the next day. The first job was to receive $1455 to my bank account and cash out $1380 of it, put that money into the Bitcion machine I visited the day before, and fill out another report form. The remaining $75 was to be my commission for completing the task. I did what they asked, sent in my report, and waited to hear about what task I would be doing next. They sent me a job to go to another Bitcoin ATM and do the same thing there. I told them that I would not cash out over $1000 twice in one day and they said they would send me the $1000 and cash out $920 for the remaining $80 was to be my commission. There was an error with the money transfer to my bank account and alerted them of the problem and was told they would fix it. I didn't hear from them until the next day and was told to send them my bank card number to complete the money transfer. I replied that I was not sending them my card number as the account number should be more than enough. They insisted they needed it as the task was to be completed that day. I asked to be sent another task to do and was denied as the other task had been given to someone else and that I would have more tasks the next day. They never contacted me again. I sent them emails for a couple days asking if there were any jobs to do. Still no reply. I then looked up to see if this was a regular thing and turned out it wasn't and that they were trying to scam me. Thankfully the funds that had been sent to me were by Interac e-transfer and they could not void the money that was given to me which was what I was most worried about as I would've had to pay back the bank all the money I had received.",

In exchange, I was required by Prolympian to create a listing, get certified in their technique (mandatory), and serve a minimum of 9 clients per week.

They use this alleged contract to get professionals to sign on and pay $1000 USD, yet they refuse to show the contract to those who have joined.\nIn addition to failing to provide the services paid for, this is looking like it could be a pyramid scheme.

The area code for their number does not come up as a valid area code.  Actual text is as follows: Now hiring part-time Mystery Shopper.  Earn $400-800 weekly.

I think I may have been scammed and I have already cashed the cheque because when i went to the bank and asked i had 2 seperate tellers inform me that it was a legitimate cheque which made me think that it wasnt a scam at first until I called mr.

I asked why they didn't do a phone interview. My question was ignored. I was told that I had five days of probation/training tasks. The first \"task\" was really suspect. It involved them requesting I accept a transfer of  a large sum of money and \"spend\" or \"do\" stuff with it in various locations around Calgary.\nAt this time, I started noticing that many of the emails contained grammar errors that a professional company would have screened out. I was also unable to find ANY proof of a Calgary location for Pairsoft Solutions and Helena told me it was being \"renovated\" and that I would be working there \"soon.\" Googling this company also pulls up no relevant results, leading me to think they deliberately hide their website from search engines.\nThey do have my personal information, including my address, a picture of my driver's license, &amp; a small amount of banking info (they said they pay employees via transfer before asking me to do \"training\").\nI declined the job offer, so I don't know what other \"tasks\" they wanted--but it's clear that none of what they asked me to do was relevant to the job offer and seemed illegal.",

    "Description": "From the outset I was under the impression I was working with private individuals. However after receiving the check today referencing the above company - I don't want to implicate the company but this must be inside information or a person in a capacity to be able to use company checks. I responded to an advert for a Caregiver in our local paper for which the people were going to pay me 1 weeks salary upfront, until they arrive in Canada (from Australia) to have a face-to-face meeting with me. I felt very uneasy, especially when their emails took a very commanding attitude about what they wanted.\nThe check I received today is for $3,250.74. I am to deposit it into my account, withdraw $400.00 for myself and hand the balance of the $$ to \"someone\" I would be instructed to meet.\nInstead I went to the TD bank (which is the bank account for this company). Upon presentation they immediately informed me it is a fraudulent check.\nMy emailing was to: Tonya Williams, her husband being Murray E.T. Williams. The check today came under cover of a MEMO - undated and signed by Mr. James Alexandre as Financial Advisor. I am not sure if this company is aware of this, I prefer handing this information over to you (I will be taking this cheque to the local police station  tomorrow morning as well).\nI am very nervous to share anything on email as they already have my address, my email # and my mobile number.\nThank you for your help.",

I was excited as the opportunity was a dream($4800 per mo plus benefits) so I replied saying I am interested and they sent me a survey with only 3 easy questions. I was more excited when I was told that they picked me for the job and that I am to start on Sept 26 but I will be working from home prior to that and they will send a laptop and a cheque to cover accommodations and supplies to use for the opening. I started to get wary about the job when I couldn't find any other info about Retec, only on what says on their website. I even asked my previous employer if he got a phonecall for references from this company and was told no. The Employment Confirmation looks legit and believable so I went ahead and told them I accept the job. I got a phonecall from '****' (************) saying I have to send my name, address and cellphone# so they can send the laptop and cheque. And they are also sending an agent to meet with me so we can go over the job and he will bring me to the new office. Sept 9 was when I got the Job Offer letter with more details. The most obvious question I noticed was the salary says US$1250 per week and the Director's name written was ******* ******* but the one signed for it is a certain '***** ** *******'. I called ****** ***** to ask him about it but was told to send an email for all questions so I did. After I found the BBB story dated Sep 8 about the scam, I called our local police thinking they can use the info that I have as a lead on maybe catching these scammers but I was told they can't do anything as there's no money involved. I got another email from them today asking for me to sign and send the job offer letter and that I have to confirm whether I can meet the agent on Sept 22 or Sept 23. I still haven't reply. Any chance that somebody can meet up with this agent and get them jailed with the scammers?",

    "Description": "Hello,\nI&rsquo;d like to report a job scam. I&rsquo;ve been applying for jobs actively and I recently received an email from a Mr. ****** ***** (likely a fake name) from a fake company named Retec Consulting. The email said that they obtained my CV on LinkedIn and would be calling me about an interview. I later received a phone call (voicemail) saying that I had been fast-tracked and would be sent an email survey to fill out, then would be contacted for an interview if I was qualified. I received the email survey and filled it out and forwarded it on. A couple days later I received an email saying I had been hired; no interview necessary as they suddenly &ldquo;believe interviews do not guarantee success on the job&rdquo;. Naturally, I was excited at first, but then after some consideration, it just was not adding up. I did some sleuthing and confirmed that this was most likely a job scam, so I sent the following email to see what kind of response I would get. It explains some of the discrepancies I found. I hadn&rsquo;t mentioned the fact that $4800 a month seemed a little steep for an admin position- this was one of the things that sent a red flag flying.\nGood morning,\nI would first off like to extend my gratitude for this opportunity you have presented me. I do, however, have a few questions and concerns. I am currently employed and will not be able to accept this job offer without some clarification; I have heard of a lot of job scams going around lately, so I just wanted to clarify a few things, which I hope you can understand. First, would we be able to set up an in person interview? I know the job offer stated &ldquo;We do believe that interviews do not guarantee success on the job&rdquo;, however it would alleviate some concerns that I have, which as a reputable employer, I&rsquo;m sure you could understand. Typically, some form of interview is done, as well references are usually asked for. I feel an interview is important to get a better understanding of the company that I would be working for, the job that I would be doing, and of the people that I would be working with. Also, I never directly applied to this position and went to search on LinkedIn for the Retec profile and Mr. ****** ***** and could not find either anywhere, so I am just a little confused at how you accessed my CV/profile, as you had stated in emails, LinkedIn is where you obtained it from. Also, the documents you&rsquo;ve sent me say to email hr@retecconsult.com, however I am receiving all of these emails from hr@reteconsult.com- which is one &lsquo;c&rsquo; short. I tried googling your location (1368 Ouellette Ave, Windsor, ON N8X 1J9) and this company is not coming up under this address, as well there is no address indicated for the new Ottawa office. Finally, these red flags made me search under the Better Business Bureau and I was unable to find your business anywhere&hellip;\nPlease understand that I am just taking the necessary precautionary steps for addressing my concerns about legitimacy, as a few of these things are what job searchers are told to look out for as a &ldquo;phishing scam&rdquo; when in the midst of applying for jobs. I hope you can understand my predicament. I look forward to hearing back from you.\nI later called the number on their website and it described nothing of the company and just said &ldquo;hold while we transfer you to a representative&rdquo;, then I was dropped to the voicemail. I noticed the building they claimed to be in had other suites/businesses in it, so I called the &ldquo;******* ***** ******* **** ********* *****&rdquo; and asked if they knew if this supposed business was located in the building. The woman said that she received 4 calls already about this and that one woman actually came into the building looking for it and that, no, it did not exist. This is what 100% confirmed to me that this was a phishing scam. Luckily for me, they received no information other than my name, email, and phone number. No credit card numbers/SIN number was handed out, so I&rsquo;m assuming they will be unable to access anything they were looking for. Please advise me if I am at risk for something that I may be missing?\nI will forward all the emails that were sent to/from upon your request. The website/email/phone numbers are below. I also have reason to believe the website is part of the scam, as I stated previously, it does not look like this business even exists.\nhttp://www.retecconsult.com/\nhr@reteconsult.com (is the email &ldquo;Bishop Brown&rdquo; was sending emails from)\nhr@retecconsult.com (is the email on the website and the one that was indicated in the documents they forwarded me)\n1-226-246-4613 is the phone number that called my cell and a woman left a voicemail on (all other phone #&rsquo;s in this area of Windsor seem to start with the area code 519- as per my call to the ******** ***** ******* **** ********* *****&rdquo;). Also the phone number on the website is different.\nPlease feel free to email questions for any clarification/ more details that may be needed. Also, the emails may have some more details in them that you may need, so again, I will forward them upon request. And again, please email me if you believe I should be any further concerned about anything that may have transcribed.\nThanks and have a great day!",

Then I received an email offering me the position wanting my info to send me a laptop and money for supplies to set up an office here. Up to this point I have not spoken to a real person nor have they specified what city I am in, I have attached the final offer email. My husband is a software developer and got concerned when looking at the website as it is really under developed for an IT consulting company. I was almost to excited at the prospect of a job to look into it, but the more we did the creeper it got including the voicemail when you call the company not using a company name at all . If this is a legit offer that sucks for me, but i wouldn't want someone to get hurt by this in the terrible economy  we are experiencing.",

When I researched about the company, I found so many discrepancies. Those are listed below:\r\n1. The telephone numbers provided on the website +1 (667) 401-3532 and +1 (902) 700-6907 are entirely automated. I called both numbers at least 50 times, but each time received an automated voice response.\r\n2. The company website claims that they have been in business for over eight years (http://www.dynamarkgroup.com/our-company.html), but then why the website/domain was created recently on 23 June 2016 (https://who.godaddy.com/whoisstd.aspx?domain=dynamarkgroup.com&amp;prog_id=GoDaddy&amp;k=PbiceghLhDtKTmVF%20TSF3vRAvIxuiBvmYx8OP%2f4%20cE3z5mG0BV5VpwsZFN9%20BxOt)?\r\n3. The company claims that they have been rated A+ by Better Business Bureau (http://www.dynamarkgroup.com/our-company.html). However, I couldn't even find this company on BBB website.\r\n4.  I could find neither the company nor any employee on Linked In.\r\n5. The company does not exist on various company databases like Glassdoor and Indeed.\r\nTherefore, I am certain that the job offers from this company are fake. There's already a complaint against this company on BBB scam tracker where the person/victim was asked to use his person bank account during the probation period.",

    "Description": "On the website nannyservices.ca, I have a profile where I am seeking employment. I got a message this morning (Sunday August 7th 2016) from a guy claiming to be \"Joey Tai &amp; Susan\". The part that concerns me about him is that he asked me to email him my ID before coming for an interview! He said that he might interview me in person on Monday or Tuesday. He hasn't told me a location for an interview, nor a time (just Monday or Tuesday, that's all). I have never had an employer ask me to show them my ID before coming to a job interview. I am concerned this might be an identity theft scheme. I don't understand why they can't wait one or two days for me to bring my driver's license to them in person. http://www.nannyservices.ca/nannyjobs.asp?SEARCH_JOBID=110481 . Joey's employer ID # on the nannyservices website is 107075. I didn't find a listing for this business name on the bbb website. I also googled the name of the company, and only found some ads on Craigslist and Kijiji, and the website of the company. His first message to me said \"Hi [someone else's name]\", so I'm worried that he might be trying to collect data on other job seekers on the nannyservices website. I phoned my mom and dad and boyfriend, and they all said they weren't sure it was legitimate or not.",

    "Description": "<p>Received an e-mail from a Jack Jones to say that I had replied to their ad on indeed.ca, for an Executive Service Manager position. According to the website that was provided, the company is in Baltimore, MD. Below, is the job description and application form:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1em;\">_\nPosition: \t\t\tExecutive Service Manager\nHours(Full-Time):\t\t9 a.m. &ndash; 5 p.m.\nSalary(Full-Time):\t\t826 CAD /per week + 5% for every completed order.\nHours(Part-Time): \t\t25/week (flexible working hours)\nSalary(Part-Time):\t\t461 CAD /per week + 5% for every completed order.\nProbationary Period:\t5 business days; only 5% for every completed order.\nDuring the probation 5 days you will only be getting the commissionable based job. Then you will be getting the 826 CAD (full time) or 461 CAD (part time) salary + 5% for every completed order.\n(You'll have a salary weekly, direct deposit or check.)\nBenefits:\nFull Training\nHealth and Dental Insurance\n25 days of holiday, plus bank holidays and your birthday off each year\nGrowing opportunities\nFlexible Working-hours\nBrand smartphone for work with internet access (iPhone or Android device)\nPhone Interview: according to the rules of our company you will have a phone interview after completing the required documents.\nJob Type: home based, full-time or part-time. You can easily combine it with any other job you have. You must have access to the internet from your PC/laptop and you can start working with us.\nTraining: we provide a probationary period with support. All necessary training you will receive from your personal manager.\nImportant:\nBank account for work: During the probation period you may need to use your personal bank account. Your account will only be used during the probation period, after passing it you will be provided with a company account. It is inconvenient to open a new business account for every person that has not yet passed the probation period. Our company will be fully responsible for every transaction that will be made during the probation period.\nGeneral Purpose:\nPerform clerical tasks related to the efficient maintenance and processing of transactions from customers. To become an Executive Service Manager you must have good organizational skills and be able to work under deadline pressure. All of the job that is ahead of you is according Canadian  Employment Standards code RSA 2000.\nScheme of Work:\n1. Accompany sales: Prepare, verify, and process payments;\n2. Verify that transactions comply with financial policies and procedures;\n3. Transfer money to headquarters/branch;\n4. Keeping accurate records of operations.\nWhat exactly you will have to do:\nReceive and transfer transactions from our customers and clients for the services that they purchase at our stores. For the Executive Service Manager this means using the online transfer institutions. All necessary information will be given to you after passing the employment election process.\nJob activities:\nWe sometimes have customers that owe us funds and pay us in financial institutes cashable only in the local area.\nSince we work all over the world, it is much easier for our customers to transfer money to our Executive Service Manager who are in the same area.\nAfter receiving the funds Executive Service Manager must record information about the transfer and report. Then send money to one of our branches or agents.\nWhy do we need Executive Service Manager?\n1. Reduces % of taxes (avoiding double taxation.);\n2. Reduces expenses for offices maintenance (as Executive Service Manager is an official company's representative, so the servicing of offices is not required.);\n3. Number of clients has increased (many customers can not make an international money transfer.);\n4. Our service has increased (as the international transfer needs about 5 days to reach our official local office and then a couple of days to reach the performers branch. Consequently, it slows down our work significantly. It would be much faster if Executive Service Manager receives the money and directs them to the appropriate department/branch.);\n5. Improves quality of reporting (each Executive Service Manager is responsible for one's region. That system allows us to quickly and accurately make up all the reports and avoid their mess up.)\nSTRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL\nPersonal Information\nFull Name:\nPlace of residence:\n_______________________________________________\n(Number Street City Province Postal Code)\nCell Phone #:\nLandline Phone #:\nAre you at least 18 years of age?\n\u0006   Yes      \u0006   No\nWhen available for work?\n________________________________\n(Month/Day/Year)\nWorking Hours Desired:\n\u0006   FULL-TIME ONLY\n\u0006   PART-TIME ONLY\n\u0006   FULL- OR PART-TIME\nAre you currently employed?\n\u0006   Yes      \u0006   No\nIf \"YES\": Company Name:\n___________________________________\nAddress:\n___________________________________\nWork phones:\n___________________________________\nWork days and time\n___________________________________\nReferences\nPlease note here the names and addresses of two persons from whom we may obtain both character or work references.  One of these should be from your current or last employer.\n1. Employment reference:\nName: ______________________________________\nRelationship to applicant:\n______________________________________\nAddress:\n______________________________________\nTel:\n______________________________________\nFax:\n______________________________________\nEmail:\n______________________________________\n2. Personal reference:\nName: ______________________________________\nRelationship to applicant:\n______________________________________\nAddress:\n______________________________________\nTel: ______________________________________\nFax: ______________________________________\nEmail:\n______________________________________\nDECLARATION (Please read this carefully before signing)\nI confirm that the above information is complete and correct and that any untrue or misleading information will give my employer the right to terminate any employment contract offered.\nSigned                                                                                                   Date: _______________\nI confirm that all of your information is confidential and will not be available to any third parties.\n________________________\nHR Chief Executive Signature</span></p>",

'******** *********' responded with the job description and asked for a response to the email if still interested in the position. Employment forms were sent to me. I completed them and emailed them back. I was told I was on a probation period for 2 weeks, in which I would be paid $23/hr and if hired full-time after probation, pay would be $38/hr. She needed my direct deposit information to set up payments. I asked if we could do e-transfer or PayPal instead as I did not feel comfortable sending that information to someone I never met. She was okay with that. Projects with deadlines were sent to me for me to complete. I did a couple (PowerPoint presentation on local housing, universities, attractions, etc, etc) I asked for a verification on payment structure, no response. I asked about the validity of the company, no response. I Googled the number- scam cautions, without a traceable name showed up. I called, no response. She also had had me download Viber app to communicate/track hours and I messaged her on there- no response. Her unresponsive, even when I told her I was suspicious of scam and was going to report it, leads me to believe she is not the one who is responsible for this.",

The first email made the job sound like an admin assistant job.  After replying yes, I received more information and from reading the job description and frequently asked questions, it seemed like a scam.  They expect you to receive email money transfers and then send the money internationally.  This is money laundering.  You should never accept money into your personal account and then transfer it along.  In frequently asked questions they state that you only have to use your own account for 14 days while you are on probation and then you will have access to a business account.\nBe aware as this could put you at risk with AML guidelines.\nBelow are the links I was sent to read up on the job\nJob Description: http://www.globaltransferbitgroup.com/mcareers/copportunities/mjobdescription\nFrequently Asked Questions: http://www.globaltransferbitgroup.com/mcareers/copportunities/faq",

I was interested in why they were emailing me, so I went along with it and sent them a copy of my resume.\nThe next day a lady with a thick accent called me and said \"I have some questions to ask you.\"  I said, before you ask me anything I have a quick question: I do not live in New York, does your company have an office here? She said we are opening one in Canada and I asked where in Canada.  She said she was not allowed to tell me where, but it will be opening near my location and I said why can't you tell me.  Then she said we will email you the location, now I have questions to ask you.  I ended the conversation and said I know this is a scam, I'm not answering any of your questions, and I will be reporting you.  I then hung up.\nI am not sure what their intentions were because I hung up so early.",

The name of the person sending the email Ryo Hirooka and his HR rep (that name seems to change). Ryo Hirooka appears to be a real person but this is not his correct email.  The real tip off is that the job is supposed to be part time and won't interfere with your current employment.

I had dealings with Mysurvey Canada before so I said yes and sent them my email. They then sent me an email on May 16 saying the job description and what I would be doing, then they asked for my mailing address and postal code to see if there were any jobs in my area. On May 21 they responded saying that my application has been approved and that they are processing a cheque to send to me in order to complete the job. It sounded fishy to me immediately but I didn't do anything.\nOn May 26 I received the letter and cheque payment of $1,823.90. The cheque is a legitimate cheque from a company called Pride Pak Canada Ltd. However, I knew this was too much money and didn't cash it, I immediately started researching this scam and found Mysurvey Canada even posts warnings about this scam.\nI have also called the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501 so that as many people know about this scam as possible.",

For the first training day they had me withdraw $1800 they had e-transferred me and deposit them as BitCoins which I did. They then informed me that they needed more BitCoins and we're going to transfer more funds for me to repeat the process. The second e-transfer would not go through and after many attempts, they stopped replying to my emails.

    "Description": "I apply often for jobs on the indeed website. I got an email from a lady named Anne Keller. She informed me I had all the qualifications to fill a position and their new office would be opening on May 30th, 2016, in the Atlas Business centre in Edmonton, AB. So I sent my application. She did not ask me for social securities numbers, only the basics. My mother then checked scam advisor and the site is 23 days old, based out of Germany or China, with a short life expectancy. The host name was hidden, as was everything related to the website, to hide their identity. She said the mans name was Stefan Huber, owner/operator of the North American division of Trimension Capital Holdings and he would be contacting me. She gave me a fax number as well that I have listed above. Obviously this is a scam, but I'm not sure on what to do now that I've sent the application. I hope someone can help or call me to figure it out. Thank you.",

    "Description": "I applied for a personal assistant job add through indeed.ca -- The \"recruiter\" took my name and address from my resume and told me I had the \"job\" without verifying any references, meeting me in person or even a phone call. The \"recruiter\" claimed his name was Gary White. Gary sent me e-mails indicating I had been given the \"job\" and that he was to send me a starting bonus as well as money to purchase a laptop and office supplies.  I had e-mailed him asking several questions about the business and did not get any responses to my e-mails. He then started texting me asking if I had received the e-mails. 3 days later he mailed a check (not certified) by registered mail to my address. As soon as he realized the envelope was received (due to it being registered) he was in constant contact by email asking if I had followed the instructions in regards to depositing the check he had sent so that I would use the funds to \"purchase the laptop\" and \"business supplies\". I had a feeling this was a scam since the beginning, however now this was abundantly clear as the check for $2,400 was not certified, nor did the \"business\" information match the so called \"consulting business\" he operated as an entrepreneur. The check itself was apparently issued by an international bank called ICICI BANK CANADA located in Scarborough, Ontario. The check was issued from a supposed company called \"Amen Gospel Media\". This had nothing to do with the so-called \"consulting firm\" that Gary White owned and operated.  All of his e-mails had poor spelling and grammar.  He did not answer any specific questions.  The address he sent the registered mail (the check) was a rental apartment in a shady neighbourhood near strip clubs in Hamilton. None of this added up. I have shredded the check and blocked Gary's email and phone numbers. Please take caution, especially on job websites like Indeed where supposed \"employers\" have access to your address and phone number. Always take caution.",

    "Description": "I BELIEVE I WAS A VICTIM OF AN ONLINE EMPLOYMENT FRAUDULENT ACT\nAt a glance, their website was professional looking and inviting to the wonderful possibly of a great job opportunity, so I immediately responded to a guy called Ronald Lumb, IT Manager&rsquo;s emails and said I would be happy to accept the position of Executive Administrative Assistant to the COO. They said they were moving their company to Calgary, Alberta on June 6, 2016 and I needed to search for furniture pricing, quotes, pictures, downtown Hotels to accommodate them when they arrived. They even went as far to draw up a Job Acceptance Letter that I had to sign and send back to them, which I did. I immediately proceeded to research what they had on their list. The first call I received from a guy that called himself Michael, told me that I should receive a Company Credit Card to purchase the furniture and office supplies and equipment and the cheque made payable to me for 3 weeks of salary. Once I got off the telephone I realized something was terribly wrong and I should read their website from A-Z and see if something might be out of sync.\nWhat raised the following red flags:\n&bull;\tThey had 3 errors on the website.\n&bull;\tThe address and number was from 2 different Cities and the Company didn&rsquo;t exist in the City in which it states.\n&bull;\tThe Job Acceptance Letter said I would be working for the COO but there was no mention of his name. The letter stated my official start date was May 15, 2016, yet they wanted me to research pricing, etc. immediately.\n&bull;\tI received a cheque via UPS but no Company Credit Card.\n&bull;\tHe asked me to immediately deposit the cheque in my bank account, which I did. After doing this, I decided to research the company and bank name&rsquo;s addresses. I contacted the company and the bank and they said they have not issued this cheque and don&rsquo;t have any dealings with one another.\n&bull;\tI kept getting a telephone call from Ronald Lumb, IT Manager asking if the cheque cleared. I said no it hasn&rsquo;t, it takes 5 business days to clear. He said: It should only take 2 days maximum.\n&bull;\tThey called me from an unknown number, so their company name would not appear on my telephone display area.\n&bull;\tHe wouldn&rsquo;t answer any of my questions regarding the Company Card and how much of that money was to be disbursed to furniture, office supplies and equipment. He kept saying: I need to speak to Michael and will call you back, which he never did.\n&bull;\tThey had strong broken English and I could barely understand them. I kept asking them to repeat themselves.\nMy concerns are: they have my signature and address in their possession and I cashed an illegal cheque. I contacted my bank to advise them of this and they said all that will happen, it will be rejected and sent back to where it came from and no money will be deposited into my account.\nI&rsquo;ve kept all of the exchanged emails and a copy of the Job Acceptance Letter; and I&rsquo;ve written down the information that was on the cheque for my records and the UPS envelope. I believe I was a victim of an online employment fraudulent act.",

I thought the whole thing was very suspicious.  I went on-line to investigate further and discovered that this is a scam. Manpower Group is apparently at G-151 Slater St. #089, Ottawa, On K1P 5H3. Contact is: Daniel Graham, email: hrmanpowersurvey.com.  No telephone number was provided.  Please let me know if you are aware of this particular scam  and if so if I should report it to any other authority. Thank-you for making the community aware of these despicable scammers!  Fortunately, I stopped this before I lost any money.****** *** *** ***",

    "Description": "There is a \"publishing consultant\", as he now markets himself, going under the name Realmwalker Publishing based out of 13290 W. Mill Rd. Malcolm, NE 68402. The \"owner\" of this company calls himself James Drake although he also uses the name Lee Aarons.  His modus operandi is that, after joining several author's groups via Facebook, he contacts self-publishing authors via private message requesting either samples or complete works by the targeted author.  He then signs them to an exclusive contract, with the author signing over book rights to Drake. Over the course of months, he maintains contact with \"his\" authors on a fairly regular basis, reporting various activities he claims to have completed i.e. getting the author's books into major book stores such as Barnes &amp; Noble and Indigo Bridge. He also claims that Indigo Bridge is affiliated with Indigo Chapters Canada and can get the book released throughout the U.S. and Canada. I have since learned that Indigo Bridge not only has never heard of Drake but Indigo Bridge is in no way affiliated with Indigo Chapters Canada.\nA few weeks ago, in a group chat where issues regarding payment and product was being discussed, he claimed that he was in way over his head and that he was returning the publishing rights to each individual author and they could hire him as a consultant. He sent payment schedules to each author, offering various forms of payment i.e. bank transfer, Paypal, Western Union, personal check, etc.  To date, the vast majority of authors have yet to receive payment.  In some cases, the personal checks have bounced.\nThru various conversations between the authors, it was discovered that this is not the first time he's pulled this scam.  It seems he brings on a group of authors, sends the book to Ingram and Amazon then receives payment from Ingram and Amazon.  Instead of passing the money to the rightful owner (the author) he seems to be using the current group to pay the previous group as he most likely spent the money.  As I said, this is not the first time he's pulled this scam.  Drake has also claimed that he is no longer taking on new authors however, within days after announcing he was no longer acting as publisher, he has started actively recruiting people who he doesn't realize are aware of his scam, looking to create yet another new group so he can use their income to pay for the previous group.  Knowing there was a group of authors that have already been thru this with him, it appears that he's using the money generated by book sales from group B (the most current group) to pay group A and now is attempting to recruit group C to pay those in group B that are yelling the loudest.  I'm certain his has no intention of paying each and every author as there are authors in group A that still haven't been paid 2 years later.",

    "Description": "I was offered a Personal Office Assistant job part-time to work from home.  The email came from hr@fraserformrental.com which doesn't exist when searching for it on-line.  The job description was given and seems reasonable but the person named Valerie Chisholm said she is hearing impaired and therefore all information would need to be done via email.  I did fill out the questions asked because none of them asked for account numbers etc.  I called Fraser Form Rentals in Surrey BC and they confirmed that this person does not work for them.  They are using the name of a legitimate Canadian company.   I hope that my identity does not get stolen from the bit of information that I did supply to them.  Thank you.  Here is a copy of the email sent to me:\nAttention: Sir/Ma'am,\nI got your Resume and your application for the job site. But I regret to inform you that this position you applied for has been occupied, after further scrutiny made on your resume we are pleased to inform you of the available position at the moment.\nI'm looking for someone that can be trusted and reliable to work very well with good understanding as my Receptionist/Personal Assistant(PA). This position i am offering is home-based and flexible, working with me is basically about instructions and following them,so i need someone who can be able to meet up with my irregular timings. As my Personal Assistant, your activities among other things will include;\nPrimary Responsibilities:\n* Creating orders/pick slips/invoices/credit memos.\n* Reaching out to Foster homes on my behalf.\n* Running personal errands.\n* supervisions and monitoring my clients while i am away.\n* Scheduling programmes, flights and keeping me up to date with them.\n* Acting as an alternative telephone correspondence while I'm away and when needed as i am hard on hearing that is why computer works for me.\n* Making regular contacts and drop-offs on my behalf. Handling and\nmonitoring some of my financial activities as the case maybe.\nBasic wage is $580 Weekly\nI'm sure you'll understand I tend to have a very busy schedule at this point. Please note that this position is not office based,because of my frequent travels and tight schedules, it's a part-time work from home job and the flexibility means that there will be busier weeks than others. I have reviewed your Resume and I think I am impressed with it and would like to give you an immediate trial, so if you are interested kindly get back to me.  As I have been checking my files and schedules and would need someone urgently to run some errands for me this week/next week, while I am away. I will have some funds sent to you from one of my clients to complete the errands and would get back to you with more information on that, get back to me with your Personal/Contact Details such as:\n****YOU ARE TO REPLY DIRECTLY TO MY PERSONAL EMAIL****\nFULL NAMES:\nADDRESS,Include Apt # If Available:\nCITY:\nPROVINCE:\nPOST CODE:\nHOME PHONE #:\nMOBILE PHONE#:\nEMAIL ADDRESS:\nSEX:\nAGE:\nPRESENT JOB:\nThanks in anticipation of your prompt response\nYours Sincerely,\nValerie Chisholm",

    "Description": "I answered an ad on facebook on March 4 or 5 from a company called Canada Shoppers to become a secret shopper and earn $400.00 a month. I filled out an application.  They asked for my email address and phone number. I received an email from a Tony Hamilton who worked for Human Resources at Shoppers Canada stating that they had accepted my application. He asked for my mailing address so they could send me out a Cheque so I could begin my first assignment as a Secret Shopper Agent. I received the Cheque on March 15.  It was in the sum of $1864.70. I was to deposit it and then send a picture of the bank teller receipt as proof of deposit. I was instructed to email it to Canada Shoppers at info@canadashopps.com.  Then Tony Hamilton called me. The phone number he called from was; 1 647 638 9175 and said that he received it and that he would send my first evaluation assignment by email which I received on March 17  On my first evaluation it stated that  the cheque payment that was sent to me included the $ 400.00 that I was to keep for myself.   I was to go to a Shoppers Drug Mart in St Albert, Alberta. I was to be a secret customer and evaluate the performance of the teller at the post office in shoppers drug mart.  I was instructed to send a moneygram in the amount of $ 1000.00 to another secret shopper evaluator agent by the name of Kinzie Sparks in Atlanta Georgia so he/she would have the amount required to conduct other evaluations. The only other information attatched to that name was a phone number;  14042511415.  So with the money exchange and a $ 75.00 transaction fee the total came to $1421.53 and I was to keep the remaining $400.00 for my earnings.I sent my evaluation report and took a picture of the receipt and emailed it to info@canadashopps.com.\nI received a phone call from my bank yesterday informing me that the cheque that I deposited from Forresters Financial did not go through and that my account was overdrawn.",

    "Description": "I work in the film industry. I have recently heard multiple complaints from people looking for work as a background extra that they have been scammed by a woman who refers to herself as both Jasmine Pike and Simona. Qualified Background Agents do not charge background extras who they hire onto their roster, and receive payment via commission on any work they secure for their rostered background extras. All complainants stated that this woman was charging $200 to sign up with her, yet had received no work in exchange, sometimes up to a year later. When I called Jasmine-or-Simona at the number listed on the craigslist ad, and confronted her as to why she was charging $200 for what should be free, she nervously stated that this was a fee for taking photos; all that is required to do background work is a simple photo of your face that anyone can take of themselves on their phone or camera. I am incensed that people looking for work are being prayed upon in a manner that leaves them with even less money. I believe she only accepts cash. The phone number this woman can be reached at is 778-********, and her address is *** ***** ******, Vancouver, BC.\r\nThank you for your help in this matter :)\r\nJasmine Pike (Simona)",

I have included below some literature on the company along with a few items that will be helpful.\nAcademic Tech Partners acquires the licenses to new inventions and technologies that are developed on college campuses and in government labs. As you may know, they receive about $25 billion dollars in grant money from the United States Government and are non-profit facilities. This prohibits most of the inventors from commercializing what they create.\nWe are the 3rd party company that purchases the rights to sell these technologies to the general public. Once we acquire the license for the new products, we start the process of introducing them into the general market. Park Technologies covers production, distribution, marketing, and sales.\nPark Technologies has been commercializing technologies and inventions from Major Universities going on 3 years now.\nI would like to share some further details about the offer and our expectations:\nYou would assist with Current and upcoming technology evaluations\nMultiple evaluations upon receiving our list will be asked of you.\nUpon agreeable technologies the company will use current staff to properly validate each technology sought after.\nAgreed upon Equity will be 50% of each technology you evaluate and decide on. This will be the same for each technology you and the company acquire over time.\nOur current lawyer will assess the royalty deal to be discussed with the particular inventor or school of each technology.\nAssistance with running the company formed will be expected upon the start-up phase. This takes place after Private Placement has been obtained for said technology, and we have the legal right to bring in pre-revenue.\nI have listed some websites I wish to share with you along with their corresponding passwords. You will also be able to access our investor pages which will provide you with more in depth detail about our companies.\nwww.titanbrick.com - password: green\nwww.2020display.com -password: goodbyeglasses\nhttp://quantumde.com -a password is still being created for the investor pages.\nwww.advancedmuscletech.com -password: muscle\nwww.newcropscience.com -password: plant\nwww.titaniumlaser.com -a password is still being created for the investor pages.\nwww.plasmastreamtech.com - password: fuelsaver\nUniversalscrewdriver.com - a password is still being created for the investor pages.\nNanoadhesivetech.com - woodpanel\nhttp://iddrillingsolutions.com - a password is still being created for the investor pages.\nIntelliroutertech.com - a password is still being created for the investor pages.\nhttp://predictiveaviation.com - a password is still being created for the investor pages.\nHere is the link to our newest Magazine Article: http://worldclassmagazines\nOur company website: academictechpartners.com    Password: tech\nPlease do not hesitate to give me a call if you need anything.\n--\n--\nThank you,\nNatalie\nNatalie L.

As a consultant with a focus in international business, the majority of my clients are out of Province and out of  the country. I need help with my errands because I am constantly out of town. As a matter of fact, I am currently on a business trip to Paris, France at this time. I will prepay you in advance to do my shopping, Bill payments and have the items sent to my PO box. I will pick the items up from the post office when I return from France third week in April.\r\nHow soon can you start? I will email you the list and pictures of what to shop for so you can do the shopping at Sears,Walmart, Best buy and other stores. I'll pay you $300 for your service for 10 hours every week. I'm prepared to pay for mileage/travel expense.I will provide clear set of instructions for each task I need done and sufficient funds to cover all errands. I'd love to meet with you upon my return from France to discuss the possibility of making this job long term. Well, let me know if you can do the Job.\r\nHope to hear from you soon.\r\nRegards,\r\nRobert Turner\r\nThis did not sit right with me so I started to research finding that there is in fact a Robert Turner under management of Adastra Corp. I sent an email to them to alert them of the email I had received:\r\nGood evening ~ it is said if anything sounds too good to be true it probably is. I have done research and cannot validate that&nbsp; is in fact valid although I did find a Robert Turner under management on your website and at LinkedIn. I have not sent my response by return email as I want to confirm that this offer is valid or that this is a scam. I would wish it was valid yet want to ensure that I am not being scammed.\r\nI would appreciate your feedback if only to ensure that you are aware that this is in play on Craigslist </p>\r\n<p> Also I would ask that you advise Robert Turner so that he is aware that his name is being used in this scam as people that are not aware of this may believe it to be true. It did not sit right with me; although I would have been ready to accept this offer, so I researched it fully only for the search to prove more suspicious than not.\r\n</p>",

    "Description": "I was sent an email offering a job from RonaldJordanpositionca@mail.com. He claimed to be from Escrow-Service Human Resources. I was offered the Customer Service Representative position at their new location in my city. I believed it to be an office job so I gave them my CV thinking it was legitimate.\r\nAfter that email I received emails from  Hilary Swank at senior-manager@escrow-service.us. I was sent forms to fill out and send back, but also documents about the job responsibilities and about the company. The wording was very legal but some parts of it were worded oddly but very professionally. it was with these documents and forms that the job went from an office or warehouse job to an at home job. The job turned out to be moving money around through a personal bank account.\r\nI opened a new account so that my personal account couldn't be touched. I'd rather not think about what would have happened if I'd used my own account.\r\nAfter sending confirmations about being ready to work I wasn't getting any more instruction after being told to wait for a phone call that never came. I emailed again and got a repeated email which I replied to differently and when the reply came back odd I realized then that the emails were computer generated.\r\nI still have all the documentation and emails and am willing to provide them should they be needed.",

    "C": "Mar 11, 2016",
    "D": "35000.0000",
    "Description": "I met an owner of a \"construction company\" on a greyhound coming home from a vacation and in need of a job.  He took a liking to me and gave me his business card and said if I wanted a job to give him a call.  I have a diploma in land surveying, and was expecting a job more along those lines, but almost immediately he wanted to make me a partner to his company (Fascina construction Inc.).  This was odd to me, but he seemed to be very genuine and said things like \"I've always ran my business going by my gut\" and \"I see a lot of potential in you\" etc.  So I decided to give it a chance.\nFrom the get go I told him I was inexperienced (I am 22 with zero business experience) and wanted to take things slow.  He agreed, assuring me that I'd have all the time I need to adjust and get comfortable with running the business and managing staff, saying it isn't that hard and I'd pick it up in no time.  I started off at $25 per hour and would be put on salary if I signed the partnership agreement.  So I started working for him, shadowing him and helping him set up the \"BC division\" of the company.\nIt didn't take long at all for him to start hitting me with high pressure sales tactics to get me to invest in the company and sign the partnership agreement.  He would say things like \"this is your company too\" to get me to sign for things and pay for expenses, promising I'd be reimbursed for it at months eds or something like that... He was taking me to dealerships and picked out two brand new premium trucks for us and had the sales people do a week's worth of work, pricing out a huge list of customizations (He never ended up getting those trucks).  We were meeting with realtor's, looking for a warehouse and office space to set up in.  There were multiple local businesses we were dealing with to get decals, equipment, furniture etc. and it all seemed above board.  he had shown me the certificate of incorporation, GST number, last year's books and a host of other things trying to get me to sign.  He was over affectionate (not in a sexual way) and started saying things like \"you're family\" and \"I'd do anything for you\" in order to build trust I assume.\nAround the 2 week mark is when I was expecting my first paycheck, but beanstream supposedly messed up their direct deposit and they needed to \"restructure their payroll\".  He started paying me out of his pocket in small increments of $200-$400.  This shaddy payment style went on for about a month.  In that time I had agreed to sign the partnership agreement (he is very persuasive).  My investment would be $2000 and a company vehicle, which we got from the same dealship working on the trucks. The car is a 2012 Accra approx $30,000 with taxes, warranty, and everything else added on.  The company would lease it from me making that portion of my investment being my name and credit on the car.\nI started having doubts about the legitimacy of the business because we never seemed to do any real work, I still hadn't seen a jobsite, any other employees, equipment, or clients.  He hooked me with delusions of granduer...  I did some snooping around some files in the office and I found a mortgage for his residence with a different first name on it.  A quick google search brought me to a newspaper article from Terrace BC about a man with the same name as the mortgage papers and age of my \"partner\" involved with multiple counts of fraud with the local businesses.  I was shocked and went to the RCMP to try and find out what to do.  They weren't allowed to give me any details on him, but one sergeant told me off the record that they new him and told me to get out of the situation...\nI eventually confronted him and ended the business relationship and am currently trying to get back what is owed to me.  I have recieved my pay surprisingly enough, but the $2000 investment, credit card expenses and loan payments for the car are all being held back.  He has supposedly sent the reimbursement for the credit card expenses twice via Canada post and purolator, but I haven't recieved them.  He was making the loan and insurance payments on the car (he signed a lease agreement with me) but this month he has been extremely difficult to deal with and still hasn't paid and it doesn't seem like he's going to.\nI am at a loss and don't know what to do, I cannot afford a lawyer and the cops were entirely useless beyond telling me they knew who he was.  Hopefully this will stop others from making the same mistakes as me and lead to some sort of justice.  There is more to the story but I don't have the time to get it all down... Thank you for you time.",

    "Description": "As an employer entering our busy season we required a casual laborer/shipper to work in our plant  in late October 2015. We had placed an online ad through Craigslist in September and were contacted via email by the labour agency GTA Employment who said they had staffing available to us. Coincidentally and at the same time a person looking for work had uploaded their resume to indeed.com. When we called GTA Employment about their worker they sent him over the next day. The problem is that the worker had never applied to GTA Employment to represent him; they somehow got a hold of his resume and sent him to us. He never was asked to visit their business to fill out any employment forms or be signed up for payroll. He started to work for us through GTA Employment - he received his 'pay' in cash payments delivered to our business. Feeling suspicous about this unbusiness like practice I was told by one of their HR 'professionals' that the worker was considered a 'contractor' and so was not on regular payroll with requisite source deductions. I find this highly irregular and while I can't prove anything I think this individual has been short paid.",

    "Description": "The company name is Strike Consults from Ottawa, ON phone# 1.888.569.8450 or 1.613.413.6014. I applied for a job on Workopolis for an office Admin assistant. Sam Peters sent me a email to tell me that they had reviewed my resume and they wanted to offer me the job. They told me that I don't have to interview for the job because anyone can do well on a interview and my there resume look good but they was going to give me a job an put me on a 90-days probation. The job pays $1,000 a week after taxes and getting paid bi-wkly. Monday-Friday 9-5 with all benefits included. He stated they were expanding the company in my city and would be officially open March 1st but i was to work at home for the month of February until everything was finalized. He also sent me n email telling me he was going to send a check for me to buy the office supplies and inventory that is needed but never once told me the address or much information on the company.\nSam also told me to contact him via email as soon as i received the check and that i was to report to him only and wait for further instruction. Red flags -  I couldn't find information about the company online, google cannot find anything about the company and the address is some random building, he ask for my address which is on my resume (and he stated he had) and know company is going to send you money to buy an entire office worth of inventory.",

I decided to investigate their website only to find it was not secured or verified like other sites are and had no \"https\" address. I then investigated the alleged HR Assistant (Michelle Tonna)and Development manager (Oliver Pasani) on linkedin. Neither of them had a profile picture or any other connections apart from eachother. I then came across a story on a scam warning blog from an individual with a story nearly identical to mine.  I also checked the address they provided on their website for their headquarters which yielded conflicting results. I have cut off contact since then and will not be contacting them again.",

    "Description": "Scammers are now using job sites like Upwork to convince people they are hired and they advance money to them for 'working materials' in the form of a cheque.  They insist you deposit the cheque in an ATM (not through a teller), withdraw the money to be forwarded onward to someone else.\nThe cheques they send are fake and PLEASE DO NOT CASH them!!!  You will be liable to the bank to pay the bank back, and in the worst case, most likely have your accounts closed and unable to open new accounts anywhere else, and possibly be charged or investigated for money laundering.\nSome tips when job hunting online:\n1) ask for confirmation of whom you are talking to - ask at the very least for a employee ID card from the interviewer\n2) get their location and verify it.\n3) ensure they are communicating from their corporate email address.  Using a free service like Yahoo, or GMail is a good tell tale sign they are fake, and/or if they use free chat apps like Hangout to 'interview you'.\n4) never advance money to an potential employer.  If they don't provide what you need to do your job, they probably are not legitimate\n5) watch especially for 'work at home' opportunities.  These are easy targets to hide suspicious trends in their scam\n6) especially watch since the job market is not the most favorable in areas with job losses; these scammers prey on those in dire times.

He got back to me this morning and said I was hired and they would be sending me a cheque for $500 and once I received the cheque I was to go to the bank and cash it and then let him know once it was deposited and they would send me my assignment to go to one of the banks he mentioned in the email and do an evaluation as they had been reported as giving poor service to customers.  The original area code he texted me from was 902 which is NS or PEI.  I went on BBB but could not find this company.  I ******* ** ****** ******* **** *** *** ***** ******** ******* ******** *********** *** *** *** **** **** ******* as it named 4 legit companies who work out of Canada.  I also found it suspect that he did not have a link to their website in the email if a legit company.  I sent him an email back and told him I would not be cashing cheque unless he sent me legal proof of their business based on my previous research of the company which looks scammish.",

I had a very brief telephone interview Monday, which I assumed was a preliminary interview. A couple of days ago, I received another email saying that I got the job, but it was the most unusual and strange letter. It had asked me for my full name, address and phone number, so that they could send me money too book hotels, laptops and software. When I asked for more information, they stopped answering. Furthermore I looked into their company, it's hard to find on a Google search, you can only find it when you search Gold Consults Wellington St Toronto. They don't even provide a postal code on their website and lastly, when you call the telephone number on their site no one answers and there is no legitimate voice mail. The scammer didn't get anything more than my resume because I caught on fast that something was weird. Please do check into it before it happens to someone else.",

    "Description": "I posted an advertisement for part-time house cleaning in Kijiji.  When I least expected, I received an email from a man in Washington State telling me that he will be moving to Windsor, Ontario with his family for a limited time as he has been hired to do some kind of research.  I looked up this man's name on the internet and I saw that he is a very well known and educated person.  I was impressed by his impeccable writing.  He wrote that they were a Christian family, that he has one child and one along the way and that he needed someone to help his wife twice a week with cleaning, running errands and so on.  I may add that the pay was good. He wrote that they were moving to Windsor after the Christmas holidays.  After a few weeks of texting back and forth, he sent me a list of items to buy and a cheque for $1,940 to cover the cost.  Since I was not comfortable in buying merchandise for someone else I told him to buy his own when they arrive.  In the meantime, I deposited his cheque into my bank account.  A day or so late, I received an email instructing me to send this money to his landlord, who was vacationing in Mississippi because the house he was going to rent still needed some renovations and he had to pay for them.  He said to keep $50.00 for myself for my trouble but being an honest person I proceeded to send the whole amount to his future landlord via Western Union as instructed.  Lo and behold, I almost fainted when the bank phoned to inform me that the cheque which he sent me bounced.  Happily the bank reimbursed me this money because, quote \"I have been a loyal customer for many years\".  I contacted the police and they are passing this information on to the OPP in charge of the \"fraud\" department.\nPS - On closer look, the cheque that was sent to me from the scammer had a Quebec address.",

    "Description": "I received the initial offer from MFX Investment Co to be a Shopping Evaluator via my cell phone. The compensation offered was $300 per assignment. I would evaluate stores, banks, etc. as to their customer service. I applied to the email given &amp; recently received a letter that I  had qualified &amp; had been approved to be a Mystery Shopper. The letter was supposedly from a company called MFX Investments. However, the cheque enclosed for $2343.90 was signed by a different company, Mawer Investment Management Co, in Calgary, Alberta. They asked that I deposit the cheque in my bank account by Dec/15 &amp; send them a copy of the deposit receipt.\nI suspected that this was not legitimate so I contacted the Calgary Better Business Bureau. They responded &amp; told me the steps I needed to take to verify that it was a valid offer. The first recommendation was to contact Mawer Investments to determine if they were part of the Shoppers Evaluation Program &amp; if they were affiliated with MFX Investments. I did this today &amp; spoke with the Chief Operating Financial Officer. She confirmed that this is indeed a scam &amp; that they have no affiliation with MFX Investments whatsoever. She had received 5 other phone calls about this offer. She asked that I scan the cheque, letter &amp; the envelope it came in &amp; send it to her. She also asked if I would speak to the RCMP if she gave them my name. I, of course agreed. Anything I can do to make other people especially seniors like me aware that this is not legitimate &amp; to not deposit the cheque into ones bank account. Once they have the copy of the deposit slip, then they will have your banking information &amp; a worse scenario I cannot imagine.",

He said I fit the profile of the type of persons they are looking for to fill part time Silent Shopper positions.  I am an employed senior citizen.\nThey requested my age, type of employment and home address to determine if I indeed qualified.  I thought nothing of it and wanted more information about the offer.  I received a few emails from them over a period of a couple months, and was eventually advised in a \"congratulatory\" email that they would like to have me work with them and that they would be in touch.\nWeeks went by until a couple weeks ago when I received an email saying I would receive a \"package\" in the post with full instructions to begin my assignment.  The package was a letter in a plain white envelope and contained what appears to be a legitimate cheque in the amount of $4,487.10.  That caused me to think twice and look into this further.  The return address on the envelope is P.O. Box 9009, Ottawa, ON K1G 6S1.  The cheque is issued by British Columbia Investment Management Corp (bcIMC), with address: 301-2940 Jutland Rd. Victoria, BC, V8T5K6.\nThe cheque account: The Bank Of Nova Scotia, Broadway &amp; Oak, 1004 W Broadway, Vancouver, BC, V6H 1E6.\nAccount # 023830 20370 002 02060 16.\nI was told to deposit the cheque, then send an email immediately when that was done.\nI DID NOT deposit the funds.  I sent an email saying I would not deposit the cheque because I suspected a scam and would check with the authorities.  That was two days ago.  I have yet to hear back from the Project Manager.\nThe letter which arrived with the cheque is unsigned.  The footer says only:\nProject Manager\nUniversal Consult LTD\nadmin@universalconsultltd.com\nIn God We Trust\nToo good to be true is always the best barometer on a scam.",

    "Description": "<p>1. Applied to an advertisement in the paper for a Mystery Shopper. </p>\n<p>2. Received phone call from Scott Madison of Shoppers Voice Canada, who gave me a phone interview on Monday, July 27. The pay would be $100 per &ldquo;visit&rdquo;. </p>\n<p>3. Scott called back on Tuesday, July 27th saying that he would like to offer me the job but I would have to be trained first. He said that a package would be arriving the following morning. Since I had a previously scheduled meeting at 2:00 PM, we agreed to call at 3:00. </p>\n<p>4. The package arrived before I left for my meeting. It included a cover letter and a bank draft from &ldquo;Tangerine Bank&rdquo;. The draft was for the amount of $2,256.00. At 3:00, on July 29th, I called Scott and he told me to proceed to my bank with the cheque and deposit it and withdraw $1,100. He said we would need that amount for the first portion of the &ldquo;mystery shopping training.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>5. I was then told to proceed to the WalMart in Barrhaven and, in particular, the Technical Department. Scott said to ask to speak to an employee and ask for something that I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily familiar with (but that I was familiar with). Then I was told to purchase something worth between $20 and $30 from the $1,100. When I was talking to the employee about one of the cables, he made a mistake on the price, so, I jumped at purchasing that cable, even though it was over the $30 because it was a great deal. So, my first purchase was for $39.99 plus tax. </p>\n<p>6. I was then told to go to the McDonalds inside WalMart and describe what happened. Then I was told to go to Western Union that was within WalMart. I was to go get a &ldquo;green form&rdquo; and go back to McDonalds to fill it out &ndash; with his direction. He had the wire going to Fitz Chalifour &ndash; he said it was a generic name that he was getting off of a list. He said to put that he lived in Ajax, ON. And, we were going to send him $940.00 cash. I went over to the Western Union desk and the money was sent. Once that was done, I was asked for the number on the receipt &ndash; along with other information about the transaction. </p>\n<p>7. After that, I was asked to go to Metro in Barrhaven and buy $20 to $30 in groceries and pay particular attention to the bakery department because they had complaints about bread being stale. So, I bought a few things and spent $35. Then when I was leaving the store, he called me to see how things were. He asked a few things about the outside of the store. Then he asked me to do another Western Union transfer. He gave me some information &ndash; again going to the fictitious Fitz Chalifour but this time he lived in Toronto, Ontario and the phone number I was given was 613-769-1966. This time, the $940.00 came out of my bank account from the remainder of the Bank Draft noted above. </p>\n<p>8. Once that transaction was completed, then I was asked to head over to Shopper&rsquo;s Drug Mart and purchase a Vanilla Visa Card in the amount of $150. He then asked me for the number on the back of the card so that they could use the Visa Card. </p>\n<p>9. I was asked to put the receipts from Western Union and the Visa into an envelope and send it to Kevin Washington at 20 Blue Jays Way, Toronto, ON, M5V 3W7. </p>\n<p>10. They had made a mistake by not sending me another cheque the following day as it is their preference that the training is held on three consecutive days. When that opportunity was missed, the long weekend was upon us so, they had to wait until Tuesday, August 4th. That is when two more cheques arrived. One in the amount of $2,256 and one for $2,356. That is when we realized that the first cheque had bounced, which meant that I was out $2,256.00. If I had done this for three consecutive days, I would have been scammed out of $6,868!! </p>\n<p>11. This fraudulent activity has been reported to the police and the report number is 15-196135. Since then, the receipts that were sent to \"Blue Jays Way\" were returned. Today, I received a text from MFX INVESTMENTS - phone number - 613-793-5538. It read as follows: \"MFX INVESTMENTS are currently hiring Shoppers in Canada. Earn $300 per evaluation. If interested, send names to: info@mfxinvestments.com.\" I believe that this text could be related to the previous Shoppers Voice Canada scam. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

My auntie applied for it, filling in a simple questionnaire and within days received a ridiculously good 'job offer' to her email.\nThe company claims to be from Austin, Texas. However there is no record of them anywhere but their own website (www.seanenergyandgas.com) - and that domain has only existed since April of this year (my auntie was contacted in May). I have also noticed that all the wording on the website was stolen from another legitimate UK business, changing only the name &amp; addresses.\nAfter a few emails, my auntie was told she needed to pay $1500 USD for a US work visa, to be wired to India via Moneygram. Luckily, I have persuaded my auntie not to go for it just yet, however she is still pinning hopes. The correspondence has become more demanding and horrible in the mean time. I can see online that many other jobseekers have had the same emails and demands for $1000 Visa payments, the same scammers emailing on mass.\nThese scammers don't seem to be limited to just this one website. They have created other similar scam sites such as Greathon Energy and Gas, Devon Energy and Gas, Echochese Energy and Gas... all fakes from what people say on the internet.\nIt is a really sad and anxious thing to see someone you love falling prey to evil people like this because they are vulnerable and eager to work.",

They offered $27 an hour for an Administrative Assistant position. I went through one phone interview and was told it was between me and another person. I was then sent a letter two days letter offering me the position and what it may entail. After further investigating because I felt something was off I realized it may be a scam. Their website only offers the same phone number and email address that was contacting me. There was not a general office phone number. The \"HR Director\" was able to text from the number posted online so I figured it was a personal line. The site also doesn't offer much information. I then googled the company and nothing was coming up. I looked up the address and it is a building that allows many companies to rent out offices so I could not verify that they were actually there. I received a cashiers check in the mail so that \"I could go get the supplies for the office to make their transition to a new location easier.\" Once the check came I looked up the bank online and called them. The representative could not find a check with the date and amount that I provided. She then asked where it came from and how. I said Canada and the mail. She immediately said it was fraud. It was also signed by Woodrow Wilson. I also looked up the HR Director's name and could not find anything on him. All together, the person's ultimate goal was to scam me.",

    "Description": "The person received a letter from the company saying they had been shortlisted for an administrative position and was asked to do an online interview via Intervue.ca; where the applicant video tapes themselves answering some questions. The company was opening a new outlet in Edmonton and Toronto. All this time, the company never called the applicant. Then, a week later, the company sent a letter stating the applicant had been chosen for the position and asked for full name and address and direct phone number so that they could send a check and a laptop to start work. The check is supposed to be for stationery and hotel booking arrangements for the managers of the office opening day. After further research, the applicant found out that the company website had only been registered in less than a month even though the company claims to have been established for more than 10 years. And the address doesn't match its postal code. When the applicant tried to look up the company on bbb.org; they were not listed at all. But interestingly, the day after the applicant wrote to the HR manager requesting more information, the company suddenly appeared listed on bbb.org but without any accreditation or information at all. It was impossible to find any more information about this company or former employees or clients. To anybody who is contacted by this company, please be aware and do your own research before making any decisions.",

    "Description": "I had first applied online to an official looking site about possibly working as a mystery shopper.  I Had then received a phone call \"interview\" with a woman who sounded very professional, educated and asked usual job interview questions, they said they are a strictly Canadian company, and highly rated.  I had then received a letter in the mail with a cheque enclosed, saying I had been approved to be a mystery shopper.  I searched they company online and found nothing about a scam and when I searched the address it showed me there company name and everything I could find made it seem legitimate to me.  The letter had 2 assignments that needed to be done after which I needed to fax the attached service evaluation forms and all receipts of purchases to them and when completed to phone your \"assignment coordinator\" to verify completion.  Assignment 1 was to go to one of the following retailers: Walmart, Costco, HomeDepot, Sears or Best buy, and spend $100 on a product of my choice.  There were detailed instructions about what I should be checking for (i.e. service, cleanliness, products) as well as \"Customer Service Evaluation Sheets\" that had to be filled out. Assignment 2 was to Send $1865.00 through Western Union. They wrote that the reason the amount is so high is because they have been receiving complaints of people being interrogated by employees when trying to send more than $1000, and being treated unprofessionally especially to people wanting to send money to other contries. They also wanted to know if they were asking for proper ID and following all protocol, they wanted me to write down what kind of ID they asked for, if they took photocopies, as well as my service.  I also had a form for that assignment that needed to be faxed back.  The cheque sent in the mail was for $2396.23, It said that $400 of the cheque is my service fee, $100 of it was to buy the products for assignment 1, $1865 plus $31.23 service charge was for the western union assignment. They said in the letter that I needed to deposit the cheque in my own account to verify that it is me.  The letter had a Rep ID# that it said I would be using on all assignments and that if I had any questions to call the provided number.  It turns out it was all a scam and the cheque never cleared, luckily I only spend the $100 on the product assignment but I got stuck with the $48 NFS fee.  I was waiting for the cheque to clear completely before doing the Western Union transfer, but I found out that what they wanted was for me to send the money before the cheque bounced.  In our world losing the $150 made a huge difference ***** ** *** * ****** ****** *** *** ********\nHere is the info they gave me about there company:  (they used a real company name and address for the scam)\nNorthern Reflections Ltd\n21 Four Seasons Place (2nd floor)\nEtobicoke, Ontario  M9B 6J8\nTel: 1-306-415-0091\nFax: 1-646-666-4496\nWhere they wanted the Western Union transfer sent:\nName: Janay James\nLocation: Mexico City, Mexico\nPlease let me know if you would like me to fax, mail or email the letter they sent me.\nHopefully you can warn others about this scam,\nThank you",
