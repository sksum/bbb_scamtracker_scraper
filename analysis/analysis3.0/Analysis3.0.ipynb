(actually, it was even not described at the first recruitment.) [quote: i am in need of a virtual assistant for multi tasks such as data entry, basic wordpress or wix (creating a simple website with wix), and there is need for potential growth in administrative duties and position.] therefore, i accepted it to work with $300 per week. although i was working something relevant to his art project such as set up a website, online art gallary, and a quickbook account, a contractor said to me that he would like to hand over his picture to buyers with a $100 amazon gift card. at this time, i was already expected that it would be a lot of money if i did a job of buying a $100 amazon gift card to \"each customer\". however, i persuaded myself and agreed with condition that the work is for a limited time only, and i work as a substitute for a busier contractor to focus on his painting. sure enough, a contractor asked me gradually to buy three, five, twelve, fifteen, and twenty amazon gift cards. (i made 5 transaction and $5,500 in total.) the tone of his request gradually became rough, and he always wanted me to get &ldquo;today or now&rdquo;. i was a student, and i did not have much money to get for that, but a contractor promised me to reimburse money with bonus, so i borrowed money from my parents and actually purchased it and taught him the code with pictures. he promised me that he will pay a full payment of $5,500 for amazon gift cards + initial salary ($300) + bonus by tuesday, and it is still not transferred. currently, i sent my letter of resignation to a contractor, but he is still requesting an additional $2,000, and he is being asked for a reply (i do not respond recently). i confirmed my job to him once. now he said that my role is only keep buying amazon gift cards, and there is no need to do multi tasks anymore. seemed he kept texting me &ldquo;do you buy gift cards or not, do you want money or not&rdquo;. even me, i think a contractor should be done at least paying salary, and i think i should not pay a lot of money as a worker before a salary day. i also think that he knows my bank account because i set up a share merchant account, (quickbook) and it connected with my credit card. then, i check all 55 gift cards, but seemed it already used, so i also consulted people who is in charge of amazon, and they will investigate deeply. i think this is scam, and i would like to open a claim.111111111\n",

      "I applied for a Virtual Assistant position with \" TradeWeb Marketing \". I was chosen to move further with the company. They sent me an offer letter, that I read over, it seemed very Legitimate. We went over pay, benefits and training. I would be paid for training &amp; be paid bi-weekly. I was asked to download  Cash app, Venmo, Paypal, Bitcoin, Coinbase &amp; Telegram. All contact was through email  -- &gt; tradewebcareers@gmail.com and the Telegram app. I have attached email below. I have all emails and screenshots if you need more.  I felt something was off. Thank goodness I gave them no information such as bank account for  \" direct deposit \" or my SS#. They do have a photo of my ID though. That was part of the offer letter, I had to send a photo of my ID. I Then something felt off. I went to the Tradeweb Market Website and contacted the Email on their page. Come to find out They don't offer a position for a Virtual Assistant. I have been dealing with their Company to find out more about the scammer. This is not the first time in the past few months that they have been dealing with the same issue. I cut off contact before they could get anymore information from me.\n",
