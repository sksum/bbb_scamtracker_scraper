A few days later I got a text telling me I qualified and will receive my first assignment shortly. On 4/12/21 I received a flat rate envelope via USPS, it had no return address. Enclosed was a check made out to me for $2450 and a sheet of typing paper entitled, \"CUSTOMER SERVICE EVALUATION ASSIGNMENT, the letter than instructed me to deposit the check in my bank, then go to any store of my choice and purchase $2,000 worth of NIKE Gift cards in denominations of $100, 200 &amp; 500 for a total of $2,000 and the balance of the $2450 is mine for \\'survey service commission payment of $400 and $50 as a running expense\\'. I am to make these purchases within 12-24 hours and if I do I will earn an extra $150. States the survey is to \\'improve customer service on a Global level\\'. The letter also instructs me to say NO if I am asked by the Cashier/Attendant if I am evaluating their services because it will deter the whole purpose of the program. Then it instructs me to scratch off the NIKE cards I purchased and send them screen shots of each one, front and back and instructs me to keep the cards of purchased for \\'forthcoming assignments\\'.\\nOk....so, being a retired analyst immediate red flags went up. So, I looked up the Company listed on the check because the letter only offered an email address, a phone number I am to TEXT ONLY to that I recieved the check and my assignment and typed on the far bottom right of the letter ended with, Regards, Nathan William\\'s.\\nThe Companys name listed on the check was Westchester Country Club, the address was weird as it gave the address number as 12250 but the street was all in lower case letters ie: westchester club drive, and the city, st and zip were Boynton Beach Florida 33437....\\nSo I did some investigating on my own and found a Westchester County \"Golf\" Club, the checks address did not include the word \\'golf in it. So I got the ph number to said golf club and emailed them as they were closed and asked if they were in any way apart of this survey business, no answer yet. I then called the number given in the letter telling me to TEXT ONLY...and low a behold it didn\\'t even ring...or lead me to a voicemail, it was just the sound of being disconnected. I then ran the USPS Tracking number ( 9405 5112 0088 1886 7592 67)  on the Flate Rate Envelope this check and letter were sent with and found it was sent from Bangor Maine, not Boyton Beach Florida!\\nThe check I received from this survey company supposedly is a Wells Fargo check and I have the check information if needed. End result was I listened to my intuition that this may be a scam and I did not deposit this check nor am I going to answer the text I recieved on my ph this morning asking me to press yes or no as to whether I recieved it.\\nCan you please look into this and let me know if my intuition was right?\\nThis type of fraud just angers me because innocent people who desperately need work will be devastated if they end up scammed.\\nThank you.'},\n",

The opening was for a project manager and their claim was that their company dealt in the leasing of heavy machinery for international projects. This is similar to the work that I do now so I was initially not suspicious. The first email from HR came from an official email address matching the company name and had relevant contact information. The company\\'s website was functional and professional but not particularly sharp. The HR email requested a time to set up a phone call, which I provided. The phone call interview was short but contained relevant questions and seemed reasonably professional. This was followed by contact from a person claiming to be the Regional Special Projects Manager, Christopher Tuley, working out of Boston, MA. From there I was offered an employment contract that stipulated that after a one-month probationary period of training I would be offered a full-time, remote position. I read the contract and submitted my signature but no other personal information to begin what I thought was the training period. The training period would consist of 10 learning modules spread out over the one-month period with gradual increase in intensity. The first week went normally with me submitting five different sets of answers related to the five learning modules that I was assigned. Each day, after turning in the previously assigned module, Christopher would then assign me the next session while also engaging in idle, profession, chatting. The modules would consist of four-to-five pages of information related to different topics that were stated to be relevant to the proposed position. In this case, mostly related to international trade and basic supply chain management. There would be a set of ten questions to be answered after the case was reviewed. The material was generally well-written and professional with some phonetic issues that would typically denote that the content had been translated from another language but seldom were any of the problems outside what would usually seem strange. During the second week of training during one of the chats after I had turned in the previous day\\'s module Christopher broached the subject of a special project that I could undertake for the company while still during training. He stated that they were relocating a team of senior company members to a nearby city and needed assistance purchasing and installing office equipment, computers, and other accessories. Due to the company being located outside of the country and not having set up US-based purchasing cards yet, in order to assist with the project I would need to use my credit card and they would wire me the needed funds. I was immediately skeptical of this proposed project and I stated that I would not be able to  participate under the guidelines stipulated where I was required to use my own credit card. Christopher said he understood and would get back to me with any alternate means. When I next tried to contact Christopher to submit my completed module for the day I did not receive any response or confirmation of reception of my email. That was on a Thursday and when I tried to contact him on the next day I also received no response. I gave it the weekend to see if perhaps he was waiting to contact me until the next module was to be assigned but when I tried to contact him on Monday his email address no longer existed. I tried to contact the HR person, Sonya Ford, who I had initially been contacted by, but that email was no longer active either. The phone numbers provided by both of them no longer worked and the company website was gone. After some investigating I discovered that this most closely matched the description of a Office Set-Up scheme where a party looks to gain access to your bank account or credit card through the guise of it being a special project for you, the new employee. I am sure that this ESC Technology handle will not be used in the future but hopefully my experience can be of some usefulness.'},\n",

He informed me that after I passed the training period, I would be invited to stay in New York for a week to be further interviewed to see where I would best fit in the company.  At this time, I was training to be a Project Manager. Mr. Zimmermann told me that even though this job may \"seem to good to be true,\" it was not because of the work that would be required to put in.  He was right, because I spent everyday for weeks studying the material in order to pass the weekly test \"with flying colors,\" as my training manager would say. On 3/2, I received the final test that covered all the material from the past 4 weeks and ended with a self-evaluation.

He directed me to check in the following morning at 8am for interview results, which I did. He said I was approved and an employment letter would be emailed to me.

I signed up for it and the next day I started receiving texts from Mr. Paul Lucas. He said that he received my inquiry regarding the offer in EPCC as a personal assistant. Then he listed the duties I had to do which is why I thought this was real. Then he continued on saying that I could get paid $300 weekly or $700 bi-weekly and that I will be receiving money (errands check) inclusive of payment for my service through my bank channel so that I can start before he arrives.  He says that my money will be handled by a financial officer by check and asked what bank I use. That was the first suspicion that I had. Then he asked for my mailing address so the financial officer can send out the checks. Finally, he says that I will be getting the check-in a week. A week came by and I didn\\'t get the \"errands check\" so I texted him saying I didn\\'t get it on March 12, 2021. He told me when he will inform me when it comes out. on March 19, 2021, he texts me I can start by buying blank checks and told me I had to get over 100 USPS priority mail envelopes. So I do that and he texted me the next day asking for my cash app information. On March 22. 2021, I started my \"job\". He then sends me his email shoeimport44@gmail.com and tells me that I have to print out checks and mail them out the same day. Every time I tried to mail them out the scan bar at the top would not scan but the bottom one scans if the mail people use a manual scanner. He also started to tell me to go to different post offices every other day. Then he tells me that he will message me on another business line. So I started doing the job then again I mentioned the \"errands check\" and he said that he will keep me updated tomorrow as soon as he hears from his financial officer. Then this week I didn\\'t feel right doing all of these things and it seemed sketchy because again he wanted my cash app information so I asked what company he works for this morning of March 31, 2021, and he never replied back. He usually replies at least an hour or two after I texted him so that\\'s when I cut him off. I said that I will not be working for him anymore or sending out any more checks.

Here is what happened. I got an offer for a WFH job. The role seemed too good to be true, but this 'company' had a website, very professional emails, and were registered in the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions. They had me sign a bunch of official documents for employment and then told me to create a new bank account in order to tie it with a Cryptocurrency account. When I asked why I needed a personal bank account attached if I was to help other clients, I was told that the use of personal information/account is required since the exchange platforms that I would be working with accept wire transfers only from personal accounts. That was the biggest red flag, but I thought that since I did not understand cryptocurrency that maybe I just was unfamiliar with the process. Other red flags were that I could not find this company on BBB.org, Linkedin, or any other platform for reviews. Also,  the website to officiate my employment wouldn't work properly, and I had to send him a lot of information via phone. Anyway, I went ahead and tried to open a new bank account, but the process was taking a long time. I called the bank to see what was taking so long for my new account to be opened. When I explained to them the urgency I had to start this job, they immediately understood the situation and let me know I was being scammed.\"},\n",

This was several weeks ago but I just encountered the exact same scam claiming to be a different company (Under Armour)so it seems this is a scam template used by multiple bad actors. The way the scam works is as follows:\\n1. The email,  which appears to be from an HR professional, contains a job description and claims to be hiring for a full time work from home position with a generous salary (the first email I got offered $85/hour, this new one offers 50-65/hour). The email instructs the target to text a certain number (in both cases this was supposedly the \"Technical Manager\\'s\" number) and download the Telegram chat client.\\n2. Once the target has initiated contact and downloaded Telegram, they are given an interview over text. The interview I was given for the GOAT scam consisted of 10 questions.\\n3. After the interview has been completed, the target is \"offered\" the job and given a contract to sign. The contract I recieved was very bare bones, riddled with grammar errors, and appeared to be pieced together out of several different templates.\\n4. Once the contract has been signed the scammer sends a check (I received it over Telegram) that is to be used for \"supplies\" and instructs the target to deposit it with a mobile banking app and send proof of the deposit. The check  I received was for $3500. This is where I caught on to the scam; I believe it is a phishing scam for bank account information.\\nThe red flags I noticed about the communications:\\n1. All communications had some level of broken English or bad grammar.\\n2. My point of contact was constantly texting me at odd hours, so I believe the scammer was located outside the US (I am not sure where)\\n3. The point of contact was pushy and aggressive, constantly pressuring me to respond and move forward.\\n4. The salary offered was way too good to be true ($85/hour for an illustrator position which usually pays around 20-30 an hour for an entry level position)\\n5. All communications were through text only; I requested to speak with the \"HR employee\" via phone but never received a response.\\n6. I couldn\\'t find any record of a \"Michael Miller\" (the so-called Technical Manager) working at GOAT Group through LinkedIn.\\n7.

They had me order free boxes from FedEx, USPS, UPS and they kept wanting me to log on to a portal at a certain time each day but when I didn't give them my photo of my social security card and stopped stop answering the phone calls because I had already saw reviews on the better Business bureau and after finding out that their location of business doesn't actually exist they started panicking and kept leaving me voicemails tell me that I need to log on to the portal and they were calling from weird places like Kentucky one phone call had a VoIP number and all these numbers were not trackable.

When searching by job title &ldquo;data entry&rdquo; for Tropical Smoothie Cafe, there are 4+ similar postings in various cities across the U.S., all of them with the same wording that knowledge of &ldquo;high end clothing&rdquo; and &ldquo;high end fashion brands&rdquo; would be a benefit to the position. I called the phone number associated with the Tropical Smoothie Cafe in New Braunfels on Google, and a man named ***&nbsp;answered. He identified himself as the owner of the Tropical Smoothie Cafe and mentioned that it is not yet open. I asked him about the data entry posting and why it mentioned fashion, and he was evasive, eventually saying that he should get that taken down because although he IS hiring for the cafe, he&rsquo;s not hiring for data entry. When I asked again about why it would mention fashion, he told me I should ask corporate about it. I asked him for the phone number for Human Resources at the corporate office in Georgia, and he said no. I called the basic phone number online for Tropical Smoothie Cafe and was told that I could not be transferred to Human Resources, but the person on the phone took down my information as a comment/complaint (I explained the job posting to them.) Tropical Smoothie Cafe has no dealings with fashion or high end fashion, and as the owner of a Tropical Smoothie Cafe associated to one of these job postings directly said that he was not actually hiring for this position, I believe these job postings are either scams or a front for some other business.'},\n",

I replied stating I was still interested. She emailed me back and asked me to apply for the job on their website (ams-med.us). I did. Then she emailed me back with a couple of time slots to interview. I chose Feb.16, 2021 at 11:00 am EST. I was interviewed with a woman named Charlie. On February 18, 2021, I received an email congratulating me for passing the interview process and I was to sign the employment agreement (attached) that stated I was a candidate for the position and would be guaranteed the position once I passed a 1-month course with at least a B average. I would also be paid $2,000 once I finished the course. Alex Howe (Regional Manager; a.howe@ams-med.us) emailed me the employment contract, job description, and an outline of the topics covered in the 1-month training course. I signed the agreement and emailed it to Alex Howe who was facilitating the training course. There were 10 business cases to complete along with a 4-day skype seminar to attend. The 10 cases required me to answer 10 questions based on the material and submit in a Word document. The seminar had a final test as well. I completed 7 business cases and received an A for each. Then Alex Howe emailed me and stated that HR and the HQ was satisfied with my work and attitude. The next day he emailed me case 8, and stated that HQ offered me to do some procurement projects for the new office they were opening in Nashville, TN (my home location). He stated they would pay me $450 and more for each project. I would have to use my personal credit card and add a business account to my card. Alex Howe stated that the company would fund the business account. He emailed me an elaborate process as to how this would be done and why I was being asked to do this. The basic reason I was told why I was to use my personal credit card is because the company was waiting on their business credit cards that they had applied for and it would take 3 weeks and they wanted to have the office up and running in 2 weeks. I initially agreed to use my credit card with my husbands permission, because it was a joint account. However, after talking it over with my sister we came to the conclusion it was to risky. So, I emailed Alex Howe to recant my acceptance of the offer to do the projects. (I did not give them any personal information or credit card information) Alex Howe responded and said thanks for letting him know. I commenced to complete case 8 on Friday. I did not hear from Alex Howe on Monday about my grade or the next case. I emailed him and he stated we had 72 hours to complete the case and I would not get a grade for case 8 and another case until Wednesday, February 10, 2021. I did not hear from Alex Howe on the morning of Wednesday, the normal time he promptly would email me. So, I was concerned. I emailed him again and got no response for several hours. Then I emailed Deborah Council (HR Director), stating my concerns of Alex Howe not responding. She did not respond either. So today (February 11, 2021), I called their HQ business (Newark, NJ) number and got a voice mail. I called the HQ business number in Hong Kong and Italy from the website (ams-med.us). Those two numbers did not work. Then I googled their address (283 Market St., Newark, NJ 07102), it gave me a plaza. I called the plaza and the receptionist answered and stated the business (AMS Med LLC) was not in their building. And I repeated the address to her and she stated other people have called asking the same thing.'},\n",

He asked me if I wanted Bi-weekly or monthly, direct deposit or pay check. Then he asked what Bank did I use. Then he asked if I used any software like Quickbooks and PBX client. He asked if I had a scanner or printer. Then he stated that I would be entitled to benefits after 3 months of working with the company. Then he said that HR would contact me shortly by email with an employment contract which outlines my job duties, wages and benefits in which I would review and return a signed copy. He stated that training starts on tomorrow at 9am from home for 2 weeks. He stated that they are currently setting up an office at 260 Peachtree St NW Ste 2200, Atlanta, GA 30303.

My resume is located on multiple websites and they contacted me via email after finding my resume online to tell me about the available position. As someone with past assistant managerial experience, I thought I\\'d look into it and found their website to be realistic. I ultimately saw no red flags until week two of my employment when the individual who was assigned to me as my Personal Manager stopped all communication. I attempted to contact all emails provided on their website, as well as phone numbers, to try and convey my displeasure with the lack of communication I had been receiving. I quickly realized that I was never going to receive an answer from the emails I had sent and each time I called a phone number I was told that all representatives were busy so my only option was to leave a voicemails... which also received zero responses. This position was completely remote so I never saw other employees to assure myself that the position was real but for a scam, it was incredibly elaborate. I was given extensive instruction by my Personal Manager during training that included manuals and step by step instruction on performing tasks. Any time I had a question, it was answered and I was warned of safety measures when dealing with money from investment clients. Yet, I was never in contact with any clients, only performed one training task, and when I was ready to begin my second task all communication with my Personal Manager had stopped. They even assured me of tactics that companies may use to scam employees such as spending money up front, among others, that they made sure I knew would never be the case with Kalamiones Estates LLC. I realize this summary of my experience is a bit all over the place but my \"employment\" resulted in two weeks of sitting on a software they called the Back Office System, waiting for instruction for my Personal Manager, and performing what was asked of me. As I mentioned prior, early in the second week of my employment all communication halted and that is when I began to worry that I may have been scammed. So be aware if you ever receive an email from Evelin Freeman who is supposedly the HR Rep for Kalamiones Estates LLC, because once you fill out the employment agreement you will never be able to get in touch with Evelin again and anyone at Kalamiones for that matter. The only contact you have with anyone is your Personal Manager through the software system and even then you\\'re provided with an email for your Personal Manager that is definitely not in use. The biggest red flag of all is that the email for the US Representative Office Senior Manager is provided on the website and when you attempt to email him, you receive a response that claims your email was unable to reach the recipient. The line of work is real estate investment but in reality it seems the only investment that was being performed was investment into cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. But I\\'m not entirely sure what they got out of me by hiring me as an Assistant Manager other than me performing a single training task of buying $50 worth of Bitcoin using a Bitcoin ATM and essentially wasting two weeks of my time. Hopefully this helps someone if they run into Kalamiones or a similar situation in the future!\\n<div class=\"ctc-tooltip\">&nbsp;</div>'},\n",

More specifically, they are responsible for organizing, sorting, and transferring goods from one location to another. They monitor company packages from the start to finish, ensuring proper packing techniques and shipping practices. Order Fulfillment Clerk also update inventory records and compile weekly or monthly reports for the management. If you are interested, let me know.\"\\nI responded saying that I would be interested and to give me a call to further discuss the details to determine if it would be a good fit for me. I did not receive any calls just an email with a link to start the application process which I filled out. I was then sent an email that stated to start the employment process I would need to sign a document and send it back. Included in this email were 2 PDFs, one with the job description and the other was called \"Job Offer\" (attached below) which stated that I was to sign if I accepted the job offer and by signing this, the document constitutes the whole and entire agreement between myself and the company. Agreement on what? What agreement can I possibly enter with a company to start the employment process? An agreement on the policies and procedures? How can you expect me to agree to the company\\'s policies and procedures when I was told that I would receive a copy of them only after I signed this paper saying I agreed to them? Another thing that seemed off was in the job offer PDF, the company, US Parcel Flow, refers to themselves as \"company.\" Also, at the end of the document it says the offer is only valid for 5 business days and then there will be a vacancy for other applicants. However, she reached out to me, not the other way around and if other people want to apply why shouldn\\'t they be able to whether I sign this or not? To me, that sounds like creating a sense of urgency so that I won\\'t think twice and just sign it. If it\\'s legitimate why do I need to sign a paper that says I accept the job and oh yeah by the way by accepting it I\\'m also agreeing to all of these unknown things but don\\'t worry I\\'ll find out what I agreed to after I sign? I was told to email these documents to the HR department at mail@usparcelflow.com. That does not sound like an HR email. Lastly, every email I received was from charolette\\'s gmail account, yet the last one I received was signed: \"regards, us parcel flow\" rather than \"regards, Charolette.\" I did not complete the process because all of these details seem off and a little unprofessional. Now, I don\\'t know what the scam is, what happens next, or even if it is a scam but it does sound a little sketchy and I would not want someone\\'s eagerness to work to be taken advantage of.\\n<div class=\"ctc-tooltip\">&nbsp;</div>'},\n",

By Monday afternoon, I was being notified via email that FedEx sent this check to the wrong address and that it was being redirected back to my residence the next day. Tuesday came and after waiting through most of the day, I checked in via email and this person provided me a tracking number. I went on the FedEx website and put the tracking information in. It had showed that the package was in a nearby facility but the address was wrong and wouldn't be shipped because the status was pending. I informed this person via email about the situation and they said not to worry because it wasn't able to come because of snow. There was no snow reported anywhere I had checked online. Yesterday, I had waited and not made contact with this person or the hr email thinking I should just wait it out and let them contact me if there was something going on. About close to noon yesterday, i received an email from the hr contact HR@Ezesofts.com asking if I was still interested in this position. I thought it was peculiar but also thought that maybe there had been a high volume of applicants and new hires that maybe I was hard to keep track of. I replied that I was still interested in this position only to find that the email address of the hr account had gone missing. I email the interviewer and let him know of the situation. He replied back not to worry about anything and that he'd keep me posted on the package. That is when I started getting suspicious of this being some kind of scam. I created a profile on the Fed Ex website and checked the tracking on the package again. Not much had changed with the exception of now there was 3 manifests instead of one. One coming from Atkins, and two others coming from medical facilities. All these were coming from random places around the country. I called to have these packages sent back but was informed that only the shipper could stop the shipments. By the time I got off the phone with them, a fourth manifest was created. I didn't know what else to do at that point so I did a google search of the name given to me via email. I found this person had a Linkedin account so I decided to contact him via messenger. I gave him my information and told him what had happened along with also getting in touch with the real hr people at Ezesoft. Both had informed me and confirmed my suspicions that these emails and job offers were not just fraudulent, but were not even posted on their company website.\"},\n",

The company that hired me was called \"TLS-LLS\" aka \"Team of Leading Shippers, LLC\", located in Tifton, GA.\\nMy job duties entailed receiving packages sent to my home, inspect the products which consisted of expensive electronics including gold, airpods, laptops, and the newest cell phones. I was instructed to upload pictures of the sealed products and invoices to the dashboard. Next, I was to pack the items carefully to ensure they were packed tightly to avoid damage during the next shipment to the various destinations. They provided pre-paid labels via the dashboard. I had to use my own printer, paper, and ink to print them out. I was then required to tape the shipping labels on the packages and drop them off at various destinations such as FedEx, UPS, or USPS. Once I did so, I was to upload the receipts of the tracking numbers.\\nInitially, they had me fill out a W-4, which had my Social Security # and they asked for a copy of my ID. They even emailed my state benefit\\'s office a copy of my \"employee certificate\". They gave me the option to receive my paychecks via direct deposit, paper check, or PayPal. Being cautious, even after I researched the company thoroughly, which appeared to be legitimate, I still chose PayPal, just in case. They also had me order a lot of supplies from USPS and FedEx such as a large number of boxes and padded envelopes. They also said that they would send me supplies from their warehouse, such as tape and bubble wrap which I never received. They told me that anything I had to pay out of pocket for while waiting for my supplies would be reimbursed to me upon the receipt. I never received a dime.\\nThey advised me that I would be paid once a month on the 2nd of each month. It equated to $2,000 base pay and a bonus for each package that I sent out timely and efficiently. I used the TLS dashboard to navigate their system. Accepting packages, uploading the pictures of the products, and tracking receipts for each package I sent out. I saw the bonuses adding up in this dashboard after I sent out each package.\\nThe \"supervisors\" would contact me almost daily via phone, email, and text to ensure I was complying with their requirements, which I was very diligent about.\\nOn the day that was supposed to be my payday, I logged into my dashboard as usual only to find that they had locked me out of it. I called, texted, and emailed every single person on their team including HR, accounting, and the supervisors to find out why this happened and where my check was. I have yet to hear any response or reply and never received my paycheck.\\nI called my local police department to see what I should do. They did some investigating and advised that this is a \"civil matter\", and the only thing they could suggest was to report with the BBB.\\nI was anticipating this paycheck to pay my mortgage and now have no way to pay it, among the rest of the bills. I am the sole provider of my 3 young children as well. Being recently separated from my husband who is providing no financial support, and since we are in the midst of a divorce, I had to apply for state benefits prior to receiving this job. Once I received this job, the state ended my state benefits on 02/28/21 after TLS refused to provide them the requested documents. The DCF office is now telling me that since this is essentially my word against TLS, that I must report a complaint with the BBB and show them the record of it, in order to reinstate the benefits until I can find another career.\\nTLS-LLC is a complete fraudulent scam and I advise avoiding them at all costs.'},\n",

Note: Her name is actually Kourtney Finn and did not respond after I sent a separate email to her email. She seems like a Recruiter and says if interested to forward my resume to Mr. Mark R. Sullivan at sullivan@sesenbio.org. I should have picked up on this scam much quicker because there were some grammatical errors in their emails and the hiring letter needed my signature for the job offer. \"Mark\" asked me to answer a series of essay questions via email.  And said I did a great job that HR would be reviewing and to be available at 8am next morning.  I was responsive and I was awarded the position less than 24 hours after I submitted my essay answers. He requested my general information including, my name, address and my phone number, he then texted me using 617-690-8210 to make sure it was me.  I was asked to buy equipment in order to perform the training that I would be provided by the training supervisor who was supposed to be calling me after I received my paperwork and that I would be reimbursed in my first paycheck.  I wasn\\'t going to submit anything until I heard from someone on the phone and had an actual conversation about the position.  I texted him to call me and he did, he had a foreign accent but I couldn\\'t place it.  His accent didn\\'t seem to match the picture I saw of Mark R. Sullivan who is pictured on the sesen bio website and can also be found when googled.  I was confused because he sent me a phony offer letter with another person who was featured on the website, plus a W-4 and a \\'Direct Deposit Enrolment Form.  What seemed odd is that there were extra \\'s\\' added where they shouldn\\'t have been in a formal letter.  Plus after we talked on the phone &amp; I questioned him on his personal information, I hung up then he texted me: \"If you are willing to proceed further, we can terminate your hiring process\"  - he seemed to have forgotten the word \"not\" after \"if you...\" so that confirmed to me it was a scam.  No further messages or information sent after that text.  Caution: he was trying to extort $510 for the equipment and get my banking account information.  However, he will answer the phone and his texts but Kourtney will not answer her emails.'},\n",

I was sent a job description and offered a salary of $2000. a month.  The website and employee contract looked legit.   I really didn't think it was a scam because it seemed very official.  Shortly after I was contacted through email from what was supposed to be my supervisor.  I didn't think it was one of those scams because I thought my employment was to wrap specialty gift wrap items that people ordered.  When I look at my employee contract it was weird because it said for the 1st 30 days I was on probation and during my probation time I didn't have to gift wrap, which didn't make a lot of sense, but I thought it was to ensure that I was trust worthy.  I wasn't exactly sure of the details, but figured that it was going to make more sense as soon as I got started. I really didn't understand the whole process or my exact duties.  They sent me instructions and made me take a long test asking basic comprehension questions.  I passed and was contacted by my supervisor Amanda Jones. She told me to wait for my first package and then she would walk me through the steps. I waited a few days and received a package, it was a little necklace.  Since I was confused about my exact duties, I tried to call my supervisor many times and the number she gave me rang 4 times and then would just hang up.  Which was weird but  at the time I was so focused on wanting to make sure I did what ever I was supposed to do correctly I just kept calling and emailing her.  I felt like my duties were supposed to be more involved than taking a picture of the package and waiting for her to send me a label and mail out again.  It took her a few days to give me anymore instruction.  She kept saying more packages were coming but I only received the one.  Once I got her to send me the label I really starting questioning this whole job' that it didn't make much sense at all??  The label she send had my address someone else's phone number and I was sending this package to New Jersey and it came from New York, basically from where it was sent.  I didn't want to jump to conclusions so the analyzed and did a bunch of googling trying to have this make some sort  of sense.  The more it didn't, the more I questioned and I kept trying to reach her by telephone and email with what I was missing in this process. The fact that the number she gave me and the wrong telephone number referring to me was printed on label I  began to grasp this was all a scam.  My email to her started getting rude and I was trying to think I could prove and call her out on my employment being bogus and which made no sense at all.  I never put the label she sent me on the  package.  I was so freaked out cuz I realized this was a bad thing and I was totally getting scammed.  I wanted to tell them off and not have anything to do with it.  She finally called me and said I need to mail the package. I told her that I figured out her scumbag scam and that she was being investigated and that the police were gonna shut her down, that she didn't even have a real number and I wasn't falling for it.  I put her package in the original addressed and wrote on it return to sender.  I did not want any part of it.  She tried to say it wasn't a scam and that she was going to put her supervisor on phone with me. I was mad and rude and was cussing she never put her supervisor on phone she just hung up.  I was so mad I continued to write her hate email. The next day her supervisor emailed me and I responded by telling him off too.  Then she started emailing me telling me to wait for more packages and to mail mine. I responded by telling her what POS I  thought they were and where to go.  I am very upset she keeps telling me to wait for more.  Nothing so far but I finally figured out how to block them and I've been trying to secure my bank info and report to the credit bureaus about my info being compromised.  So far that's about it.  I really thought I landed a decent job and am pretty embarrassed that I fell for this crap.  Oh I forgot she told me if I mail out her package that she will send me salary immediately.  I told her I put return to sender and want nothing to do with them to leave me alone.  Now I am just praying for the best and hope that I have done the right thing without implicating myself.  I just want this to go away and am so thankful that I realized this before I mailed out anything for them.  She told me again today wait for more packages but I hope and really doubt there are anymore cuz I really told them off.  Maybe they think they can change my mind if the are gonna send me money,  sorry but no amount of money is worth all the stress of this scheme.  I just pray they have not done too much more damage.  If I continue to hear anything I will update.  But I'm pretty sure they can not contact me anymore??  I hope not.\"},\n",

I completed the virtual interview and was contacted on the same day by Ranjith Paramasivam via phone offering me employment. He immediately thereafter requested to send over my drivers license; which I proceeded to do. On Monday - 02/01/2021 he contacted me and advised that \"another interviewer\" wanted to meet with me, so I responded and provided him with my availability. On Thursday - 02/04/2021, Ranjith Paramasivam sent me another email advising that the \"manager went on emergency and the position was on hold and would update me as soon as possible\". I responded and asked if the manager had provided a time frame regarding when the position would be open again. I received no response. Randomly, on Friday - 02/12/2021 at 2:37PM, Ranjith Paramasivam contacted me via phone and requested that I meet with the hiring manager at 3:30PM virtually and he needed me to complete the virtual interview today. I declined the offer and he offered to schedule a follow up meeting with the hiring manager that following Tuesday - 02/16/2021. I was not aware until the day of the meeting that Ranjith Paramasivam was actually attending the meeting as well. Before the hiring manager joined he asked \"if I could start immediately?\".  After completing the virtual meeting with the hiring manager and Ranjith Paramasivam, I was offered employment again via email on Thursday - 02/18/2021. Before I could respond, he called me; but I was not able to accept the call. I responded via email and explained that I would need official documentation to support the offer of employment; considering I was offered employment once before, the job was placed on hold, and now an employment offer was being extended again. He proceeded to send over the pre-employment offer letter on an \"Infinite Computer Solutions\" letterhead which he requested for me to sign and send back. I signed the document and sent it back only to be contacted again the next day. Ranjith Paramasivam explained that he would need for me to sign a different \"updated\" offer letter that he would send to me. He proceeded to send it over as an attachment via email on a different letterhead that read \"Zyter\". I signed this document and sent it back to the email address listed within the pre-employment offer letter (USHR@infinite.com). I sent a follow up email to Ranjith Paramasivam advising about my actions and of course he advised to send it directly to him. At this point, there were multiple people included within his responses. When I asked about benefits mentioned within the offer letter he could not provide a response. It took for me to pose these questions to another person in order to receive a response which was very general. I was told that I would receive additional details once I was officially offered employment. On Friday - 02/19/2021, I was sent a urinalysis form for LabCorp and two additional links; one for a background check and a second referred to as a \"personal data form\". After completing the form for the background check, I was very concerned because the personal data form was formatted as an application and certain portions were frozen and could not be completed, even though there were asterisks indicating that these specific fields had to be completed and the form was asking for information that should have been collected at the beginning of the interview/employment process. I sent another email requesting additional details about the benefits mentioned in the offer letter; which were not addressed initially. I decided to send a declination email and 02/21/2021 to the last person that sent me an email and shared my extreme concerns which was the basis of my I would not be moving forward with employment.

She stated that she found my resume on Indeed, and that my education and qualifications match the copywriting position they are currently offering. I am in fact looking for something long-term now, so her proposal suited me perfectly. I inquired about details regarding this employment opportunity. She prompted me to contact Mr. France Sulick (the HR hiring manager according to her) via WhatsApp for more details. It seemed strange to me that they would want to conduct a job interview through a messenger, but I figured that this is their policy during these uncertain COVID times; I assumed they are just adhering to a no-physical contact way of interviewing candidates.\\nI contacted Mr. Sulick and he sent me two sets of interview questions: first set was about translations, not about copywriting. I asked why he would sent me a set of questions that are regarding a different position, not the one I was offered. He said that I should just proceed and I will find out later why I am asked that. The second set of questions was a general one about my personal job expectations for the position I am offered ( I'm enclosing screenshots). He then asked me to provide my full name, state, address and an email address, so they can put it in their system. It didn't really alarm me because these are standard questions employers usually ask.\\nAfter I was done with both sections, Mr. Sulick said that he would forward all my info to his supervisor for review and he'll get back to me the next day in regards to whether I was hired or not. When I logged into WhatsApp the following day, I inquired about my application status and he said that I was hired. That also didn't really alarm me as he said that they were hiring immediately and I had experience in the past when I was hired either on the spot or the next day. As far as working hours, he said that they are flexible, but I need to report to him every morning at 8 am. I wouldn't be able to report to him every morning as I have a part-time job some mornings where I am physically leaving the house and I am unavailable for a few hours. I needed to clarify this with him and tried calling him on the number listed on WhatsApp. I saw that he was online, but he didn't pick up the phone which I thought was very strange...I started feeling weird about this whole employment process and demanded that I needed to talk to him or his ASAP to discuss the situation about my working hours. He never replied to my message and never called back. My suspicions started growing, so I decided to contact the company directly on their website by filling out the online form. They responded the next day stating that the whole hiring thing is a scam... and that they knew about it, tried to report these people, but they also asked me to report them as well, so that their shenanigans would hopefully stop.\\nPlease, look into my complaint and do everything in your power to stop these scammers in their faulty endeavours.\\nThank you!\\nP.S.

       "  'DESC': 'This company first contacted me via phone and told me that they saw my application (I never applied to a company with that name) and would like me to interview. At first, I thought they were another company I had applied to (and they might have been, under another name), as they mentioned their location being in Northern Virginia, where I had largely been applying to data entry jobs. On the phone call, they mentioned data entry and I thought that was what it was about. I received an email inviting me to a zoom interview, which was followed up by a second pre-interview email reminder. The first email included info about how the interview would supposedly go, saying \"During the interview, we will discuss your past work experiences, your career goals and career opportunities with one of our hiring managers.\" This never happened, as I will explain momentarily. The second email said \"Please log on using the Link listed below. Once you\\'ve logged into the call, please put your microphone on mute until our Hiring Manager has began the meeting!\" We couldn\\'t unmute it ourselves--she muted it on her end and it was stuck like that. During the \"interview\" call, there were over 100 of us on the Zoom call, and they person we saw basically pitched the company to us in a sales pitch and told us to write notes because we would need it if we had a follow-up interview (which is one on one at a location nearest to us, a half hour before the business actually opens, which I find extremely odd). During the meeting, they told us that the job was marketing and then mentioned the parent company (Cuba Inspires), and used name-dropping to make it sound better than I suspect it is. The person told us that the owner works with clients like The Kardashians to help them obtain travel to Cuba and said that we would potentially meet with celebs and other VIPs like that (this was a big red flag to me). The interviewer stated that the company got started in the UK about 10 yrs ago, but that the US office started in 2020 (LinkedIn claims 2019). She also said that there are offices in Australia, Colombia, Canada, UK, ect, but I found no evidence of this whatsoever. At the end of the call, she told us to expect a follow-up email regarding a second interview, saying that we needed to respond between 3pm and 6pm to secure a spot for the interview. No questions were allowed during the first interview and they never respond to emails regarding questions asked.\\nI strongly suspect this company runs under multiple names and uses the same sketchy hiring practices elsewhere, under other identities. I had also noted this of interest:\\nI searched for this company through OSINT databases and Google and found very little information. The website (http://www.goinspirechange.com) looks extremely fake, like a stock website. The address (8201 Corporate Drive, Suite 250, Hyattsville, MD, 20785) is questionable, as there are reportedly a number of other companies in the same building.\\nAccording to scam advisers, the company website is hiding their domain info. It describes the owner as being a Silicon valley startup called \"Loop, Inc.\" (aka Loop Now Technologies, Inc), and their website also doesn\\'t exist. They have what appears to be a few fake reviews on Google (the only ones with commentary are negative), and the website Google links to is also fake. The 4 employees listed on LinkedIn for IEA have no background in media relations. All of the emails were signed with \"Emma\" (which I found on another website talking about a similar scam, same HR name), but none of the LinkedIn employees are named Emma. Clicking \\'apply\\' on any of the posts listed at http://www.goinspirechange.com/opportunities/# goes nowhere. The section called \"You Will Be In Charge Of\" on LinkedIn doesn\\'t seem to change much, and all of the qualifications are the same no matter what the job is--I find this very suspicious. The parent company for those two companies is \"Cuba Inspires.\"\\nCuba Inspires\\' website also does not exist\\nIts pinterest has 5 posts, none of which actually belong to the company\\nIts twitter hasn\\'t been active since 2017 and has almost no postings\\nIts Facebook is a page that Facebook created, not the company\\'s.\\nI am hoping I am wrong about this company but unfortunately, I don\\'t think I am. I think they\\'ve avoided detection until now through a combo of non-disparage agreements (which are unethical but not illegal) and changing their name frequently. They may also be a company called the Young Entrepreneurs Academy. I didn\\'t give them any personal information or money, but I\\'m concerned that others may have.'},\n",

I was ecstatic as I&rsquo;d been unemployed for almost a year. He detailed the position and everything it would entail.

I was sent a job offer letter, along with a business code of conduct and the government paperwork for employment. I reported to Cristian Bionda (supposedly) every morning and completed several tasks (writing research reports). I was sent checks via FedEx to deposit to my bank account and use partially as payment and partially toward purchasing necessary equipment. Everything was always extremely detailed and seemed completely legitimate. The first check was frozen in my bank account and they apologized, said he was working personally with the chief of accounting going over their weekly finances to get the issue resolved and that they&rsquo;d send a check from a different one of the financial institutions they work with. The second check cleared and they had me send one payment through Zelle, and they said the other payments had to go through the app Zengo by purchasing bitcoin and sending it as payment to the vendors accounts. They sent another check a few days later for additional equipment and by the time I had deposited it the second check was showing as frozen as well, even though it&rsquo;d been showing as available earlier. My account was overdrawn multiple times but I wanted to believe it wasn&rsquo;t a scam because I needed a job so badly. I ended up getting pressured to put an additional $980 on my credit card.

Their Boss goes off very disrespectful responding to me and says first of all I don\\'t like to be cut off (yet he just cut me off) and if you think that you can come here to my place of work you can forget it, fine with you I do not like being disrespected. He gets up and literally walks away from his desk says you can leave. Takes my form and fold it up then crumble it into his pocket. I still not clear on how to say this I\\'m just another black women to systemic racism and discrimination and I\\'m supposed to grin and bear minimum respect and yet I give mines away freely, and can take it away just as quickly as I give it. when I know the person in front of me doesn\\'t deserve it. So I chose to respect myself leave his office as he requested I didn\\'t refuse. I collected myself outside and when I got my mind in order I went back into suite 104 to get his name he refused very aggressively using profanity and I didn\\'t curse at him or even call him out his name yet I\\'m the ******* ********** *** ****** *** **** *** ******* ***** *** ***** ** ******** *** *** *** **** *** ** ****** **** ******* ***** *** ******\" I wish I was making this up but he was so angry and yet I was angry and proud of standing up for me it felt good not because I know I was right it was the right thing to do. He threatened to call someone as he stated word for word because that what he said since I came back I\\'m now trespassing on his place of business. I said call the police or the BBB you are the devil Man, is what I said and left for good and good riddance.

I never applied for a job that required a messaging aplication but I figured because of the Pandemic circumstances, I would have to proceed. The interview process was simple questions and Answers. Seemed pretty basic and structured. Second part was Payment and Payroll, he asked about hours, time range, Payroll interval; weekly or biweekly, payroll method; check direct deposit, bank name, and if I was in the military. I didn\\'t think anything of it so I gave it to him. After the interview the interviewer asked me to \"hold online because he needed to forward the conversation to the head department to congregate and enable them to see if [I\\'m] committed and good for the job.\" Within about 15 minutes, I\\'ve been confirmed for the position. Then he told me that the company will provide me a apple laptop with fast internet connection, mini office equipment supplies and all the programs Im going to need for the job.  For secretarial filling/ registration, he proceeds to ask me for my Full Name, Full Address, Phone/Cell number, Sex, and Email. At this point, I am so excited that I found a job, I didn\\'t even think about the consequences so I gave it to him. On the next message he says I will get started right away and I needed to set up a mini office and the company will mail me a check that will pay for it. Here is where I am so glamoured to the fact that I will be getting that stuff for free and that I will have my little office so I said \\'yes\\' the address was my mailing and same for my bank information. The next message, he said that I will be getting a check within the week to start working soon. He continues to say that he will update me and to \\'bear\\' with him. The check will be used to purchase from an affiliated vendor who customizes them. The following message he emphasizes that \"All equipment and software are to be purchased from the company accredited vendor who they have been buying from for years...\" He continues to mention the check and how to appear my name on it. Then he Congratulated me again and told me to report back the next day at 8am my time. After that conversation I felt something in my gut especially about the check. I looked up the name of the company and found a website ( https://nference.ai/ ). I look to see and make sure it because it seemed to be too good to be true. I found an address and tried to match the address on google maps. The company name does not appear on google maps in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I even looked up the interviewers name and it didn\\'t show up. I was getting panicked so I called the Mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts to see if she have heard of that company she also gave the number of the Consumer Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts. They both said they will check into it  and call me back the next day. I did more research and learned that there are such thing of job scams and there are \\'bots\\' that are programed to do it. I had no idea! I didn\\'t expect that Indeed.com would have listing of fake companies. So I prepared my self with questions to ask the next morning. I texted him at 8am he sent me a text that didn\\'t really end a question so I waited for a response. I wanted to see if it glitches but didn\\'t get response 12 minutes later. He wanted to confirm my information for my materials. I said I had a few questions. I asked him where exactly the \"Headquarters\" was to confirm the website and it was in fact the same address and website I found but not located on google maps. I mentioned that I could not pin point the location of the building because it didn\\'t have a building sign on google maps. He continued about issuing the check. I asked how long the company has been around and he said in 2013. In my head I said to myself; if they been around that long they could have at least had a sign on the building. This may not be a legitimate company. I wanted to get personal and asked him \"how long he been with the company?\" and he said 5 years and only recently transferred as a HR Manager in the Cambridge, Massachusetts location. He still precedes that I would be home for the check. I asked \"what department he transfer from?\" and he said \"why all this questions?\". I said \"I cant ask questions?\" any ways seems he was getting frustrated but he still wanted to confirm my address. I told him that I was no longer interested in the position. I was about to send anther text to say sorry and he erased all the messages and removed me from the conversation.

After some discussion, he referred me to another HR member, Helene, to interview with off of LinkedIn. Helene Le Pape (LinkedIn URL: https://www.linkedin.com/in/helenelepape/) contacted me via Skype messenger, claiming she was the HR Director for AT INTERNET. She never called or used video calls, but only skype messaging. Upon each time of contact with her, Joe would also message me and tell me that I needed to be on Skype to talk with Helene at that exact time, or even after I was already chatting with her so they are clearly working together. After a very unusual interview process and described onboarding, she gave me an offer for a remote Project Manager job and I accepted. I did research on the company, read the Wikipedia pages about it, and found the HR Director\\'s bio and headshot on the AT INTERNET website which matched the one on her Skype profile. Everything looked real. I asked many questions and they responded with complete sentences so it did not appear to be like many phishing scams where bad grammar is present and no other information can be found online. One of the first major red flags was when I dialed the phone number for their corporate New York office and the phone rang for an unusually long time, ultimately leading to a generic voicemail, \"the person you\\'re calling is not available\" then an abrupt beep to leave a message. How does a corporate company not have a phone menu and or detailed voicemail message? The next red flag was that Helene required me to pay for my background check. I was instructed to buy a visa gift card and then send the card information to her Secretary. Helene appeared to be operating from one of the French offices but her secretary was located in the New York office. That didn\\'t make sense but alas, I continued. I deducted that this was safer than disclosing any personal financial information at the time, and complied.  Next, I filled out tax paperwork, I-9, and W-4 forms, disclosing personal information and but was never asked for direct deposit information for future payment. Shortly after this, I was asked for my credit card institution login; username and password, so the company could give me \"a payment for company equipment.\" I argued with Helene about my refusal to disclose my credentials and demanded she contacts me via phone call on my cell phone immediately. She claimed her secretary would reach out. I never got a call. No one has followed up since. It was at that moment that I realized it was a scam. I am taking necessary precautions now to protect myself and my information but also making numerous reports on their fraud. I have saved the entirety of my conversations with both Joe and Helene for future evidence if needed. Please investigate their profiles and AT INTERNET SOLUTIONS before someone else falls victim to their scam. The company may be real and these people are posing as the HR team or the whole thing could be fake. It is unclear.'},\n",

Then we give you the Account Number and Routing Number to the companies checking account to make a payment on your existing regular credit card. this will be processed overnight, and the funds will be made available for use the next day.\\n{if, for example, you have a credit card with a limit of 4000, and presently owe 3400. The Company would be able to make payment to your credit card to cover what you owe. and you will be able to withdraw it from back as well} Okay?\\n2- Mobile Check Deposit which usually takes the next day to clear into your account. I can get the check deposited in your account today and the funds will be available to purchase your materials the next day.\\ninstead of sending you a check and waiting 3 days for it to deliver, I can have a check issued in your name then I have it scan and sent it to you by email.  you will print out the copy sent to you. cut to check size then have it deposited to your account today using the mobile deposit app. Okay?\\nNote. we do not need any of your banking or personal information to process this payment.\\nThis is just an option if you&rsquo;re not comfortable with it we can have a check sent to your postal address. and this is just an option to save time and you will start working within 3 days.\\nwhat do you think?\\nAre you understanding my point and are you comfortable with this method of payment?\\nSincerely,\\nMrs. Kathryn B.

Upon reading the letter, it was obviously NOT from Breyers Ice Cream, as there was no professional stationary, and looked like a simple computer printer made it.  I doubted the legitimacy due to grammatical errors and double restatement in the same sentence, and also the fact that after depositing the check, I was to pay the \"installers of the car wrap\" $2000, the remainder I was to keep as my payment for advertising. Additionally, the total amount of the check would not be available \"right away\", so this was also a red flag.

I got back on Hangouts after 15 minutes, and she let me know, I got the Job. She started sending me list of Job duties and explaining to me the process of receiving the Equipment needed, as this was 100% work at home. She asked if I could pay for the equipment and the department would pay me back. No, I don't have the money, so she was sending me check along with email with the employment forms needed to be completed within 24 hours.

I stated to both of them, That is seemed Way to Good to be True....Following morning I received the email with the Job Offer and code of conduct, I read over them carefully and even sent screenshots to my Mom and Granny.

The interview was pretty standard although it was all done through the messaging app. They told me I was hired and needed to provide my info to HR and to set up my direct deposit and I would be paid for my training.

(I was unaware and desperately seeking employment during these uncertain times.) But, then it started to get even more weird when they asked me to go to Walmart to get a One Vanilla prepaid mastercard for the amount of $100. The interviewer said it was  for the activation of the online employee portal to access the company and initiate the training. The interviewer told me it was urgent. It was starting to feel like a possible scam. I contacted the original poster in Facebook. I asked her some questions and she persuaded me saying she would help me with the start up $100. She reassured me it was a reputable company. I went to Walmart to buy the prepaid card, and the cashier at Walmart informed me it was a possible scam, that they see them often. I messaged the interviewer and asked to be put in contact with the company or HR directly. They refused to connect me and became very defensive.

The offer was a home based position and she said as soon as they look through the online application, one of their Human Resource managers will call me within 2 business days to conduct a brief interview. I submitted my application following the application link provided in the file and 2 days later November 5th 2020 a representative, a man with an Indian accent called me for a brief interview with basic questions.\\nThe next day on November 6th 2020, Amanda sent me another email with an attached file containing the link to invite me to create an account in their back office system (https://backoffice.corecapitalassets.com/signup). She asked me, once I would have finished the creation of my back-office account to contact Kate Higgins using my personal message board. Kate Higgins (kate.higgins@corecapitalassets.com) was my personal manager.\\nI was in contact with Kate exchanging emails in the back office system for training, instructions, tasks and guidance. I spoke over the phone with Brian Fuller (phone number 215-845-9455) 3 times, for procedures and tasks and requests. Brian was the Office Manager and indeed the only person I could talk to.\\nI was required as full time employee to do 4 business weeks  + 2-4 days for final determination. I have never received a final contract.\\nDuring my training, I was asked to open a bank account for work and training purpose in order to withdraw in cash the money I will receive to purchase Bitcoin at specific ATM machine in my area, for clients investments, and send the Bitcoin to specific wallets.\\nI have done 3 small transactions of Bitcoin purchase with the money 3 people sent to my bank account using the service Zelle. The people are Nelson Petcher(sent $100), Lionel Rose Stredel Prosperi(sent $75), the third transaction was a wire transfer from Bank Of America industrial LLC(sent $455). I purchased in total Bitcoin worth $300 via 2 different online websites and 1 Bitcoin ATM.\\nAfter working my schedule from 9am to 5pm every day since November 9th, I have never received my salary, beside $200 as first part of my salary paid on December 3rd 2020 via transfer on my work bank account and $130 I received as bonuses for the tasks I have done. To reiterate, I worked over two months for Novenburg Estates, and have not received payment for hours worked to date!!\\nOn December 9th 2020, Kate Sent me an email offering me a new opportunity. The opportunity was to become a Business Account Owner, in order to deal with corporate clients and larger investments amount from $30,000 to $90,000. Becoming Business Account Owner I would receive increase of salary rate From $27/her to $35/hour and bigger bonuses. Kate needed me to confirm my interest in the opportunity by confirming my personal information such as first and last name, correct mailing address and my SSN. She told me they needed my personal data for application filling and LLC registration.\\nBusiness Account Manager was an extension/upgrade of my existing position of Assistant Manager.\\nI declined the new offer and asked to work normally, the time to master all the contour of my work as Assistant Manager.\\nSo I continued to work normally and on December 11th 2020, Kate told me to monitor my bank account for possible funds allocation.\\nI didn't receive any funds until December 14th 2020 she asked me again to monitor my bank account for 2 mini deposits from clients in order to verify my account in the system for future transactions.\\nThe same day on December 14th 2020 Brian called me to require that I answer to Kate, and I told him I already did letting her know that I didn't receive any money. So Brian asked me to send Kate a screenshot of my bank account, what I did.\\nI continued to monitor my bank account every day, the transactions never showed up, until December 22nd when my online account access stopped working.\\nI called my bank Wells Fargo on December 23rd and I have been told my bank account was blocked for fraud suspicion. And I had to make an appointment and visit a branch to unblock my account, what I did on December 30th 2020.\\nI the meantime I sent numerous email to Kate via the system from December 21st 2020 to January 12th 2021 to inquire about my salary, my employment status, my account blocked by the bank, information about the origin the amount and the purpose of the wire transfer I received...\\nKate never answered to all of my concerns. After a Google image search of Kate Higgins picture from her back office profile, it appeared that the picture corresponds to a different name Holly Hirshfield.\\nI came to the conclusion that I have been scammed and immediately reported my experience to the police who offered me a case number. This apparent scam is unusual as no money exchanged hands...YET.  It began with them offering small amounts of money to invest and then I became suspicious after increased requests for more personal information that made me more vulnerable to being victimized.\"},\n",

I later learned I was not given the same quality of information I was told by WFG and also learned through Google and Youtube WFG has conducted bad practices which I never knew prior to the job interviews. For instance, wfg scam - Bing from Bing and Is WFG a SCAM? World Financial Group Review - Bing video from Youtube. I contacted Richard Duenas about this where he did not give me any concise answers. I later quit the job and have filed several disputes with Bank of America over my purchases and tried to delete my accounts on XCELSOLUTIONS and Elite Training Library. I did not receive any response from Brian Klinger, Richard Duenas or those companies.

On the night of January 6th I received a text message from this phone number +1(505)589-7687 introducing herself as Jasmine Grenier a Temporary Recruiter at Grupo Santillana Company, telling me that they were interested in interviewing me. She then provided me with the instruction to download an app called Telegram Messenger and to message someone by the name of Gabriel Joaquin on the telegram app at (702) 814-3096 to begin the interview process. I followed the instructions and was interviewed through the telegram app that night. They asked about my qualifications per my resume, normal interview questions and the only personal information they asked about was my full name, address, cell number, and email. The next morning I was instructed by Gabriel Joaquin to report at 8am via the app and he would tell me if I was selected. </p>\\n<p>I followed the instruction so on January 7th, 2021 I contacted Gabriel Joaquin at 8am and he informed me I got the job and would be receiving an employment offer letter the next day. I received the letter on January 8, 2021 via email, but had questions about the missing details so I spoke with Gabriel Joaquin on the telegram app that day to go through my doubts. I was told that a physical copy would be sent to me but that has not come in as of 14-JAN-2021. Due to some discrepancies with what was explained to me on the Telegram app and the offer letter, I asked for some revisions and they updated it and sent it back to me that afternoon (08-JAN-2021) and I electronically signed it and sent it back via email.\\nThe same day Gabriel Joaquin explained that \"we have several firms, associated and educational institutions that we work for and they will be responsible for providing the funds needed for the purchasing of the materials\" by material he meant work materials. He went on to explain that I would receive the checks, deposit them and make payments to vendors for my work materials.</p>\\n<p> He then told me that Wellsfargo allows mobile deposits and asked what my daily deposit limit was, I provided him with the information and he explained that the would be sending me a check and to let him know when it arrived so he could give me the step by step of how to deposit the funds. I received the first check January 11, 2021 via email, let him know on the telegram app, and he proceeded to explain how to make the mobile deposit. I made the deposit and sent him a screen shot of the confirmation. My banking app told me the check wouldn\\'t be available until the next day so I informed him of that and our conversation ended for that day (11-JAN-2021).\\n</p>\\n<p>The next day 12-JAN-2021 he reached out to ask about the status of the of the check, I checked in my mobile banking app and it clear, I informed him of that and sent a screen shot. That day (12-JAN-2021) He asked me to send $850.00 to an apple pay account with a phone number (405)437-8488. I did that sent a screen shot to him for confirmation and then he asked me to send $350 through Zelle to Herbygirl@hotmail.com First name: Herbygirl Last name Hackett. I did that sent the confirmation screen shot to him and then the informed me that I would be getting a second check later that day 12-JAN-2021. I received it and deposited it and let him know it wouldn\\'t be available until the next day 13-JAN-2021. </p>\\n<p>Our conversation ended there.\\nOn 13-JAN-2021 he reached out asking me if the money was available which at 6:27am when I checked it was. But later when I tried to move the money to the vendors via Zelle I was given an error message that the number I was sending the money to could not receive any more money today. So I talk to Gabriel Joaquin on the telegram app to tell him that, send the screen shot of the error and he said to wait and try again later. </p>\\n<p>I tried again around 8am and noticed the check for $1,200 I deposited on 12-JAN-2021 was gone. I told Gabriel Joaquin, and then called Wellsfargo to ask what the problem was, the customer service rep didn\\'t give much details and told me to check tomorrow to see if the check cleared. I informed Gabriel Joaquin and he asked me to cover the $600 from my personal funds and that I could take the $600 back from the next check. I told him no, and he said it was fine to wait until tomorrow.\\nToday 14-JAN-2021, I woke up to a message from Gabriel Joaquin asking about the status of the check. I checked my mobile banking app and it didn\\'t clear. I also had a message from my bank in my email saying the check didn\\'t clear due to alter/fictitious reasons. I sent that information to Gabriel Joaquin and he said a new check would be sent. I received the check in my email. I had an appointment with my bank at 9:00am to open a new checking account for this new job, and as I explained the details to the banker of why I needed this new account she alerted me that this was probably a fraud, and that my relationship with my bank would be at risk if I continued to deposit checks and distribute the funds. She also informed me that I am responsible for the amounts on the checks in case after 7 days they aren\\'t fully cleared. She asked me to strongly consider not moving forward with this \"new job\" or money moving because I would be at greater risk of owing Wells Fargo more money. After leaving the bank I started the reporting process on the Better Business Bureau page.\\nI have not lost any money as of 14-JAN-2021.\\nAttached is the first check I received. I have 2 other checks and the offer letter saved in case they\\'re needed.</p>'},\n",

       "  'DESC': 'I received an email from ginadoanhr@gmail.com telling me I was tapped for a data entry position with Periscope Data Analytics and asking me to do an interview on Google Hangouts. I had sent my resume to many platforms before so this sounded legit. I looked up the name Gina Doan &amp; found her on LinkedIn working at Sisense, which is the new company name after Periscope Data Analytics merged with Sisense (the scammer obviously stole the identity of that person &amp; used old company name to sound legit). I did the interview in writing &amp; was offered a data entry job for US$ 35 per hour (&amp; this rate for this job was the first thing that made me suspicious). I then received an email congratulating me &amp; informing me that I will receive a check by mail to buy necessary software for the job &amp; office equipment to set up my desk at home. This raised a red flag as I had heard about check scams before, but I decided to go along with it to report the scam eventually. I did receive a check for $4,950 issued by Direct Grading &amp; Paving, LLC (it exists online as a road services company in Nevada. Another name steal I guess). The sender\\'s address on the USPS envelope was William Bailey from California (it exists online as the name of a painter who died recently!) The envelope also had a flier about a Mountain Dew Car Decal arrangement with instructions. When I asked that person about the flier, they said it was sent by mistake as their agency handles many things. She (or he) told me to send the deposit slip as soon as I deposit the check &amp; they will give me instructions to keep a portion as my first payment (!) &amp; send the rest to a person who will be my trainer. I asked why didn\\'t the company send the money to the trainer directly? Why thru me? They said \"It\\'s because of the trainers, so they will be delivering and installing everything for you and put you through and to create a rapport.\" It\\'s an obvious scam. I wrote to Sisense warning them that someone is using the identity of Gina Doan in a scam, but I haven\\'t received a reply yet. I also filed a complain at https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/ .'},\n",

I received a response from their HR manager Christopher Morris (christophermorris@smilelifeline.org) to my personal email that they were interested in an interview, so we set up a Zoom meeting on 12/21/2020 at 11 am MST/1 pm EST.\\nCopy of Email Info: Christopher Morris is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.\\nTopic: Interview Meeting with Lisa Softleigh\\nTime: Dec 21, 2020, 11:00 AM Mountain Time (US and Canada) Join Zoom Meeting\\nhttps://zoom.us/j/99444644706?pwd=RmxMdW1lcElRWitZeTBDNkt2TlBpUT09\\nMeeting ID: 994 4464 4706 Passcode: K15r4z\\nChristopher Morris HR MANAGER Smile Life-Line Organization smilifeline.org\\nMr. Morris never showed his face during the interview, which I thought was strange. He offered me the position and sent me an offer letter by email on 12/28/2020 with a start date of 1/13/2021. I had to fill out an employee information form which was to provide him with my personal demographics, banking information, and passport photo ID, which I sent back to him in a confidential email via Gmail. I was then contacted by Robert Miller,(robertmiller@smilelifeline.org) the COO via email as I was told I would be reporting to him directly. He then stated I will be working closely with Martin Diaz (martindiaz@smilelifeline.org) the Account Team Supervisor for direction on my daily tasks and with the project manager(projectmanager@smilelifeline.org) to secure my working tools such as a company email, laptop, and scanner. I was told to register on an app called Telegram because that is what they use to do most of their communications on, so I did and was added to the Team. We had to use code names such as red-wolf and green-wolf when communicating, I am assuming for confidentiality purposes since they are advertised as a non-profit crowdfunding organization. Martin Diaz then sent me an email forwarded to him from Robert Miller with an attached $2,000 check from a donor that was approved for my working tools. He said the working tools are paid to the employees by donors. Martin then instructs me to deposit the check via my mobile device into my bank and send him a screenshot of the transaction on both Telegram and Gmail, which I did. He asked me if the check cleared the bank. I told him only $380 cleared immediately and that it takes 2-3 business days for my bank to clear checks, but they do release a small percentage of it right away. He then told me to forward the $380 via Zelle to their vendor Stacy Bissmeyer at (stacybissmeyer@hotmail.com) and to tag the Zelle payment \"Approved by Martin\" to get the procurement of the working tools started right away even though the entire check had not cleared yet and to also send him a screenshot of the transaction via Telegram, which I did. The next day the $2k check bounced and was returned unpaid. My bank charged me a $12 return check fee. I sent Martin Diaz a Telegram message the morning of 1/8/2021 letting him know the check bounced as well as an email to everyone, Robert Miller, Martin Diaz, Christopher Morris, and the Project Manager to refund me the $380 plus $12 return check fee, as the check was no good. I didn\\'t hear back from anyone except Martin Diaz later that afternoon stating that he was told by the COO that the donor was having some issues with their bank account and the issue should clear up soon. My bank told me the bank account the check was written on was closed. No one from Smile Life-Line Organization has made any contact with me thereafter regarding this issue or to communicate the return of my money. When I keep asking about my refund, I get no response. Handshake.com has now flagged this job advertisement as \"FRAUD\".'},\n",

The position had no link to their website, an unspecific job description, little to no information about the company, and stated that no experience was required.  Nevertheless, I applied. The email I received was from a Sadie M. on a Sunday morning and she stated they were very interested. She mentioned that the hiring manager, named Chad, recently moved to NYC from Atlanta and they were looking for a new talent. They have a three hour time window the interview could take place during and to respond with the 30-minute period that worked best. I emailed back and did not receive an email respond from Sadie until late Sunday evening. She sent Zoom login information and some tips for the interview. I became weary when the website also contained no specific information, no address was available, no employee/team photos, no past work shown, and their LinkedIn page was invalid. I looked up their domain on ICANN lookup and found that it was created 5 days prior to their contact with me and 2-3 days prior to my submitted job application. Upon further investigation into NYC marketing agency scams I concluded that the agency did not exist or it was existing under unsavory pretenses.'},\n",

After an in-depth interview and promise of a job position with their organization, they scammed me for money thereafter.\\nI first became aware of and applied to the fraudulent position on Indeed.com which, I believe, was posted sometime early December. The details of the posting on Indeed.com (which, I noted had 100+ applicants) was identical to this link still seen on karier.com - https://karier.co/job/ProofreaderCopy-Editor-The-Humane-Society-bBr\\nSome days passed, and around New Year&rsquo;s Eve, I was contacted via text by someone claiming to be a representative of The Humane Society, going by the name Devon McCoy, asking if I was still interested in the fully remote position. I said yes, and they set me up with a remote interview with another representative going by Bob Zawilski, who is listed as the Senior Consultant of The Humane Society&rsquo;s Wealth Advisory team as seen on their actual website; this Bob Zawilski was the one I mostly in-contact with. After an in-depth interview and some time passed again, they informed me that I was accepted to the job. They had me sign fictitious contracts and connect with other supposed staff via email, saying I would start training in the next few days.\\nBefore then, however, they told me they wanted to set me up with new working materials including a macbook, iphone, a time-tracker, printer, and other various supplies and software who I would pay directly to a vendor. They sent me fictitious checks that managed to clear mobile banking scrutiny which they then wanted me to use to pay the various supposed vendors with. Because the checks were only partially cleared, they asked me if I can cover the cost of the supplies, installation, and shipping with my own money to help smooth the process toward my starting work day. They assured me I\\'d be reimbursed through, and so I covered the initial costs.\\nBut then, they continually informed me that there were problems with the vendor purchase due to complications by the Covid pandemic and the holiday. They urged me for more money to help the process, and feeling threatened I\\'d lose the position, I complied. They had me pay different \"vendors\" through Apple Pay, Zelle, and CashApp, telling me they would be quick workarounds considering the circumstances.\\nAfter much money (total of $7000) had been passed on to them, I stopped contacting them briefly. I did not fully realize what happened and stopped contacting them entirely until I was contacted by Information Technology Manager, ***** *******, and Director of HR and Chief of Human Resources, **** ******, informing me of a fraudulent job posting. I closed my bank accounts and contacted the police the following day.\\nThese were the numbers of the false Devon McCoy [(215) 710-1283] and Bob Zawilski [(208) 820-4686]. The one who sent me the false employment contract went by Julia Bonsell, whose email was: juliab@thehumanesociety.org\\nI also have the email to their false HR department and their several \"vendors\" still on hand.

This is marketing exposure that has value to brands. Why shouldn&rsquo;t there be a means for drivers to earn extra money for putting an ad on their car? - It just made sense. Just how effective is vehicle wrap advertising? If a business wrapped just one vehicle, it would have the capability to net 30,000-80,000 mobile impressions each day. The Paid to Drive marketing concept has delivered follower-ship overtime for various advertisers/brands.\\nHOW IT WORKS\\nThe basic concept of the \"paid to drive campaign\" is that it seeks regular citizens, professional drivers and all vehicle owners above eighteen (18) years old, who would go about their normal routine as they usually do with a brand&rsquo;s logo or advert.These wraps are typically vinyl decals, also known as \"auto wraps\". They are carefully wrapped on a certain portion of your vehicle (either installed on both front doors of your vehicle or your rear window will display an attractive advertisement).These decals are easily removable; they would be installed neatly and carefully without any damage to your vehicle/door/window.\\nPAYMENT PLAN\\nUnder this program, you are considered as an independent contractor you will be receiving your payment weekly.

The only time a vehicle\\'s paint may be affected is in the case of a poor repaint job or if the paint is already damaged.\\nQ: How do you track my mileage?\\nA: Mileage will not be tracked and recorded. You are simply do drive as you normally do your daily routine.\\nQ: What type of vehicles can be wrapped?\\nA: Anything from Sedan&rsquo;s, SUV&rsquo;s, Trucks, and Vans.\\nQ: How will I be paid?\\nA: On Friday, at the end of each week, you will be paid via your preferred payment option (check/Venmo/CashApp/Zelle/Money Order).\\nQ: Will a vehicle wrap damage my vehicles paint upon removal?\\nA: No, 99.9% of instances, factory paint is not affected by our vehicle wraps.\\n2nd email\\nHello *****,\\nThis is to inform you that your upfront starter check payment to get you started on the PAID-TO-DRIVE Promotional Campaign, as earlier stated has been sent out.

On the first day he went to training  for 10 hours. The second day he went to Amazon for his driving test. There he was met by the &ldquo; delivery service provider&rdquo; for whom he would be working&mdash;\\napparently NOT Amazon. This man told my asked my son if he filled out his paperwork for his company. He said no and was puzzled by this(he filled out paperwork for Amazon and took a drug test) because other applicants had already received a schedule, pay and benefits package. He asked the man if he could fill it out today. He said yes and gave him an address in Hamtramck MI. My son went there and could only knock on a window not a door.  A woman was irritated that he was there. She wanted his SSN Card which he was told he didn&rsquo;t need because he had his passport and his drivers license. She took them both and made copies. She then handed him a stack of papers to fill out; all this while standing outside. He took the papers and asked if he could come in and fill them out. She said no, fill them out in your car. The first few were standard forms. Then the regulations for the company were provided. It included that they driver would be responsible to deliver a certain number of packages per day. The drivers were not allowed to make any stops and if they needed use of the bathroom they would have to urinate in a bottle and keep in in the vehicle until the end of the shift when it would be removed by the driver. If not removed they would be fined and docked pay. If they didn&rsquo;t deliver the said amount of packages they would be fined, docked pay and suspended. It then stated if for some reason they applicant left before 90 days they would be responsible for the cost of the drug test and driving test. (At this point he assumed he was already hired for employment by/through Amazon.) The paperwork had a different address on it, misspellings and white outs. My son was told by Amazon he&rsquo;d be working for them, but then he was turned over to this other delivery company called American Delivery Service. When he got there the name on the building said Shondhan Driving School. Upon further investigation we found no business in Michigan named American Delivery Service. Any info about the driving school named on the building had stories that made this business sound like a rip off or scam.   My son returned the paperwork to the woman through the window without filling them all out.'},\n",

The offer was $4,000 per month and 5% commission (also $3,000 per month and 8% commission was for another position). The first assignment was as follows:\\nI am sending you the first assignment which will help you increase and deepen your knowledge of real estate, construction and other related issues. It will be of great help for you in future. Since we are currently trying to expand the list of our US and European customers who wish to buy, sell or invest money in real estate or construction in Europe and the USA, we would like you to write a short\\\\medium size review. This assignment involves the analysis and assessment of the real estate market in your city/town/area/state. You may use all available resources to collect the necessary information: newspaper articles, the Internet, promotional materials, etc. You can include any additional information you deem necessary - links to web resources, pictures, feedbacks, etc. The first assignment is presented online, you need to follow the link and answer the questions:\\nAssignment #1\\nThank you in advance. Please confirm the receipt of this review and send it back to me tomorrow. Also all the information about your second assignment will be provided tomorrow, I assume. We already have a potential customer to assign for you. Keep checking your email!\\nSincerely,\\nPersonnel Manager\\nOrnella Berti\\ntel: (361) 454-5440\\nThe second assignment was to deposit a check in person (so called, not the only means of payment available) into your personal account and take out the commission before forwarding to a company account by another means. These appear as legitimate two party checks to the bankers that looked over the checks when deposited in person, but are close to $2,000 with a few cents or dollars short. Once deposited the bank reports it is a third party check and delays the transaction. Ornella then demands paper verification which most banks do not offer on the date delayed. The check is unverifiable which results in either release of PII to the company or ending of a banking relationship with the victim.\\nOrnella claims this as unfortunate, but assures the next will process correctly. This will also fail to transact or result in exposed account information with loss to the victim.'},\n",

The first red flag is the company website does not provide an address for their place of business. I tried to find this business on the BBB&rsquo;s website and nothing came up. The second red flag was the business website has a phone number with an 833 area code. Per the internet, an 833 area code is used by scammers per the following information:\\n&ldquo;I also learned that the 833 area code is one of several different phone numbers in the United States that isn&rsquo;t connected to any particular geographical location. The ambiguous nature of the 833 area code is one of the main reasons that it&rsquo;s so popular with phone scammers.\\nIn any event, I learned that there is not one specific 833 area code scam. They range from fake computer tech support to loan repayments to Internal Revenue Service fraud to vehicle warranties.\\nI learned that while the subject of 833 area code scam calls can vary greatly, they they usually follow the format in which the scammer calls up a potential victim from an 833 phone number or getting the victim to call the 833 number themselves by leaving a voice message. Sometimes they send an email or text message. Sometimes they even post the number in an online advertisement.\\nI also learned that if you get a warning message on your computer that asks you to call an 833 number for tech support, it&rsquo;s likely that your device has become compromised. Do not call the 833 number, and take the necessary action to secure your device.\\nOnce the phone scammer makes contact with their intended victim, they will attempt to get money, personal information, or access to a computer. They do that by pretending to be a government official or a communications company employee.\\nIt would seem that area code 833 scammers who call their potential victims usually find their targets by collecting names and phone numbers from public online directories or social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Scammers apparently also trick people into calling them by sending fake emails, text messages, or direct messages that look as if they&rsquo;re sent from a legitimate company.\\nThe easiest way to avoid being scammed by an 833 area code phone scammer is simply to never call an 833 number.\\nThe 3rd red flag was the company job posting does not have a way to apply for the position online. The job posting states &ldquo;TO APPLY Submit your cover letter and resume to JOBS@RUHM.COM&rdquo; via email.\\nBBB, please investigate this company and advise if this company is fraudulent. I don&rsquo;t want to see unemployed people submitting their resume/cover Letter with personal information to a company that could potentially be a scam.\\nThank you.'},\n",

Manager and Supervisor contact responses were only permitted which turned out to be the same person and there were specific detailed conversations discussed  to not contact the company , all correspondence would go through me only , meaning??( Stewart Taylor)and even a timeline to an advanced unbelievable salary was also included and everything I could think of to convince me that this job was real. Now I was always sceptical, but where I became more sceptical was after receiving the emails regarding the steps on how to start my first week training , and I was told to deposit them into my account but I told him I felt this was a scam and he sent me another email reassuring me that everything was very legit and I could check all paperwork with my lawyer if I wasn't sure. Then this is where he started looking for my first assignment which he said it would take 1-5 business days to receive the assignments and the same was said about my upfront salary pay which I  never received,   but his main concern was that the customer had written checks for their online purchases for the company sales transactions, and I receive them, I suppose to deposit them, collect the cash, and deduct my bonus and Haste fee from the check, and wait for instruction on where to send the cash. Now,  I did I receive email attachments with pictures of the product machinery parts sold at a certain amount with date and parts Numbers, But the customer name or any information was not compatible to the checks I received,  as for the Checks I received,  when I Googled the address it came from , it was somewhere at a Seven Eleven convenience store in Maryland. and the invoice that stating the purchase information was somewhere in in Germany.  So please I still have these checks and hope know one will try to come to my address looking for these checks because the do have my full address and phone #\\nHow can I block these people?\\nPlease help me I am scared !\"},\n",

I was so excited, I am a single mother, a disabled veteran, and just finishing up college. Once I received that initial email I suppose all of my judgment went out the window. They gave me a start date in one of the emails and I was told I would be contacted through a text from my boss. Which after looking into the company and name all seemed real.\\nOn my start date, I was told that a check was sent to me to buy the equipment needed for the job. Once I received the check I deposited using a phone app. After it was deposited I was asked by my \"boss\" to go to my bank and take out 2 cashier\\'s checks and put them into an account at wells Fargo, meaning I have a name and account number for this person. After that was complete I was told to keep an eye out for the equipment and text when I showed up for my first assignment. But that Friday the initial check from \"the company\" bounced. On Saturday I filed a police report and was told there was nothing they could do. So on Monday, I went to my nack and the checks had already been put into the account. I asked to file a fraud claim in hopes of getting the money back but was told that since I used cashier\\'s checks this was not an option.\\nSo I proceeded to call Wells Fargo and check this account that I put the money into, I was told the account was still active but I was unable to file a fraud complaint with them too since I didn\\'t have an account there. So not only will the police not help but the banks will not. I am more upset that the police and banks are doing nothing, especially since I have the name and account number of the scammers.\\nI feel violated by all parties that were involved with this, not just the scammer but the banks and police as well.'},\n",
