Job offer, Everything was stranger, perfect opportunity, high salary without experience. A person names Sarah contact me. This is the person that called me by name.
I have been contacted by Foreign Research alliance via email and they have sent me this very detailed email.
I cannot be sure if this is a real job offer but it seems suspicious. I was contacted directly by them for a position that has a high ($30+) hourly pay for a job I have no experience for. I can only find their website online and nothing else about them. They also seem very happy about me leaving.
I posted my resume on Indeed and I may have applied to their advertising. They sent me an email and asked for more information. The only thing I sent them was my phone number. The other information like my name and email address are online with my resume. I realized this employer hasn't even spoken to me and started doing some looking into the website address, the website looked legitimate which is why I sent the completed form in the first place. When they responded I looked into it a little deeper. It turns out that the address is a strip mall and the company doesn't even exist on Google Maps. This is when I decided to contact.

I was offered a job as office manager of a new office opening in Westerno. I was suppose to start my training and they sent me my first task and that's when I realized this wasn't right. They are trying so far and make money. They have my direct deposit information and my driver licence. Everything was so quiet until they said they were sending 2000$ by. and then I have to deposit 1900$ into a Bitcoin machine and keep 100$ for myself for my daily training payment. I knew this was not right at all. Find out it was a dream please don't fall for it. The ladies name was Bui Huong and she apparently says she works for a company in Toronto called Katrina Hizon Consulting Inc. the address is in the middle of nowhere when you look it up on Google. Do not let them see you and my husband helped catch this before I fell for anymore.

Employs people as shop assistants. Gets them to create accounts and post jobs to job boards like indeed, ziprecruiter, etc. and then has them call in to verify the accounts. They post jobs like hiring assistants or data entry and then collect applicant data from the job boards. I don't have details of who is being watched.
I am not sure what to think about this company. I just want to confirm with BBB if this company is legitimate or am I right with my instinct that this is a deal? I was approached via email and offered me a job for $25 dollars per hour. Email mentioned something about seeing my profile at Indeed, but I don't remember sending an application to this company. I tried researching it at Google and failed with no results. Now, they are asking me for my direct deposit information and I am a bit wary about giving my info. They also contacted me via Telegram to discuss my first day. I am also confused as in their email there are two different websites used: researchalliance.ca. and https://fralliance.ca/
I was recently offered a position at a company called the ATLAS PAYMENTS SOLUTIONS LTD. This is the website: https://atlaspays.com/ As far as I knew at first the job was completely online and didn't really have any concerns. We exchanged a variety of emails (via c.berger@atlaspays.com) regarding contracts and personal information. I can provide details with copies of the documents if necessary. I gave them information that is usually expected to be offered up when getting a new job. (aka address, full name, driver's license images, etc.) After a couple of days, she (who addresses herself as Christine Berger) replies calling me on my acceptance of the position of Customer Service Manager and that by signing the following document and sending my payment information I would be a confirmed employee (calling me from 44 20 8638 6979). So I open up the form to input my direct deposit information, and I find something a bit skeptical. They had asked me for  Bank Daily Withdrawal Limit  and  ATM Daily Withdrawal Limit, as well as the name of my stock bank, trade platform, etc on the form. This made me very skeptical, as I had received employment jobs before, and this seemed similar. I did some research on the website and found that there "Social Security" tag: (https://secure.sectigo.com/ttbr/trustlogo?vite=W ) v name=1 ( v search=https://atlaspays.com/?? and x) was most likely fake and most likely bought from this site: https://www.ssls.com/brand/sectigo-ssl-certificates?gclid=Cj0KCQjwjPaCBhDkARIsAISZN7RtkEl2d jeqcm59gzkfDJdfDAZsrYT4YNu1cRyO7sR2TSfq-BFPc8aAvNREALwj Also, any address listed on the website did not correspond to any specific location/office (might possibly be because they are a secret, not sure I've been to legitimate offices for Telus which looked very similar), but rather a virtual office space. The customer has ceased contact with me when asked about details regarding ATM/Bank daily withdrawal limit reasons. I learned that the killer was most likely trying to get me to receive fake checks and stolen cc payments, and sending them to the bank via cash or cash from an ATM.
I have been using the website Indeed to look for a new job. I was called by an individual that called himself "Edward Powell", the Human Resource Manager of BergaMine/Bergamo Inc. He said he found my resume on Indeed and wanted to offer me a position as a remote, part time Administrative Assistant with a too-good-to-be-true employment package. He requested I email him not through the Indeed platform, but his business email: edward.powell@bergaminebiz.com. When I replied to "Edward Powell", wondering about some reservations I had about the information he had provided, he ignored my questions (after having rejected them) and sent me an application form for a job in New Zealand even though they are an American company and I am in Canada with the quoted salary being in Canadian dollars, though clearly stated. When I replied with more questions and an open accusation of the job being a lie, he didn't reply back. I informed Indeed of "Edward Powell" being a name, but as I was going to email the company as well to inform them of the situation thinking their name was being used without their knowledge, I realized that "Edward Powell" was using a personal email address. BergaMine describes itself as a Cryptocurrency mining business, but I have no real information about the business itself  in fact I can't find anything about the business outside of it's polished website and a few casual forum post advertisements. I realized that the whole business was likely a fraud and so came here hoping I'd see the company listed. It is not, hence me informing you of this situation. I have the email conversation and the application that was sent to me should you require them.

Fake job posting requesting PCI
They contacted me by email saying they found my resume on indeed and offered me the buying assistant (remote) job. all the communication happened by email, even the interview. they took my BC ID, my picture and all my banking details. They told me to increase my daily withdrawal limit and asked me to convert their cash to a bank chip and them the picture. Right now, I haven't lost my money because the moment they asked me for the above mentioned conversion, I reported here but there are high chances that I can lose money. Please secure my bank funds and id.
Jessica G contacted me 03-15-2021 via email about a job opportunity because they were interested in my resume. She mentioned she was interested in my resume she found, and wanted to hire me. After I responded that I wanted more info, she pointed me to their website which provided not info, and asked that I submitted an application and my resume for review. Being confused by the entire interaction, I called their company and found the same website stating this is a family business. I never applied to this job, nor inquired about anything of the sort. I don't know how they got my info to contact me, and then I don't even work in the consulting industry! I'm a body builder!
I am currently looking for employment through Indeed.ca  so when I received a text from someone claiming to be a former "Mary Carter" from a company MedArrive Inc. who saw my resume on Indeed, I texted back. They told me about the job and sent me a link to contact the producer and wanted to set up an interview. Even went as far as to wish me good luck  and  ask me to let them know how it goes. I had to download the online app to use for the interview which was done via text message. When I asked him about doing a job interview he said that video recording is used for training (this was for a supposed work from home job). I was suspicious from the beginning so as he was informing me I was looking for the company on line. The company is legitimate although the actual  and lies are the same. My suspicions were confirmed when I called the actual company through their legitimate website. They contacted me telling me that no one by those names worked for them, and that job openings are only posted through their website. Another indication of this being a lie is that the government would not provide me with a contact # for human resources when I asked, and told me that would only be provided upon orientation. Also, the rate of pay seemed to good to be true, and they offered me a job 10 days after completion of the interview. I told them I was going to not accept the offer. I did not provide any SIN # or bank account number but they did have my full name .  the name of the bank I deal with. They would have got my address from my resume, because my phone #  1  address are on my resume.
they post job openings and lead you along to think you're working an at home job but then they saved you by getting you to buy it and sending it to them leaving people in a huge mess and even more. then they started with....
The company sent job detailed job descriptions for accounts service specialist. There were red flags of spelling errors here and there in the documents she sent. The recruitment process was so fast, in just a week. A paid 2 week training was offered. On the first day of training, they wanted to send a direct transfer of $3000 to victim's account which victim was to withdraw and pay into a local ATM.
This is a York University Students job and event site. This is clearly a trap. $8400 can be made in cash?.. Also the pictures show foreign currency. Bring on students website. Join the weak link? No one in Canada speaks this way. Sorry kid. His name is Kefas Dauson and I didn't click on it. So please just report him.
Someone with the name 'Nicoleta' contacted me with a remote job offer which was too good to be true. I showed my interest because I was an active job worker to which she sent me a link to a job application site (https://cutt.ly/8k8Gan3). It asked me for my SIN there and naturally enough, I filled it out. She was were extremely professional and the only thing that was not sitting right with me was the huge salary. After that, I was asked to fill a Questionnaire asking all the right questions! She sent to me the job offer and employment agreement, next day, which I signed. I checked on Google if they really existed and a website - with the tag www.outsourced.group - claimed to follow exactly what they had been doing so far  Initial job offers by a team  at  FOUR positions for which they were hiring .  Questionnaire  and  Employment Agreement sent out  at  Final Voice Interview. So, I entrusted them. And then she asked me to add her to my contacts on Telegram (online). I texted to her confirming my decision and I set up a 'Voice-Interview' with another person 'Matthew Attwood'. My phone detected that the call was from Jersey City, NJ, United States. I had already been calling the CRA, police and Service Canada after my chat with the them to secure my accounts and identity as I was vary of the potential errors in their messages now, on Telegram. In the interview, he only asked me the answers to two of the questions I had already filled out in the beginning and said that I might expect a positive reply. The next morning I received a job offer from their end asking from me to fill a work form. I was hesitant and texted her that I don't think I would be continuing the offer to which she removed me from their contacts - keeping the messages for me and her!! They were EXTREMELY professional and good with the documents (Job offer, signature and letter of acceptance) that I would not have known at all if I hadn't been a little suspicious and if my curiosity didn't drive me to see what job may look like: 1. They asked for my SIN in the job application before I even had the job. 2. The email was sent out via sendgrid.net (known for mass email). 3. Neither Nicole Leman (CIA Operations Manager) nor Matthew Attwood (Regional Director, North America Division, United States Department) appeared to exist on LinkedIn. 4. Those are not even real positions. 5. Switching to fast-acting app (Telegram). 6. Same errors when on Telegram (almost as if they copy-printed the acceptable email content to each victim unless they typed the whole message out on their own) 7. The mail that I had received started with a 'Dear Candidate' and not my name. Be very careful guys and do look at the others to see how professional they sounded.
I applied through a employment company, and he email me back saying how suited I was for the job, but when i called the # 1 and hung, he sent an agreement form and all, my daughter check into different company,so mad..

The email was from a "Miss Parker". I felt the offer was too good to be true and started digging about it. It seems that one other person received the same email as they had put up the a post on it regarding it. It seemed all well and good initially because in my initial search on LinkedIn "Wesley F." was a real person and a researcher for "Fusion Technologies". Fortunately, they had a website and the email didn't have much grammar error or so (the basic stop signs). Looking closely, the same company used "MerEdian" instead of "MerIdian" to trick me into thinking it's the same and probably used the false name of "Yes". I replied to the email asking for more information about the job. This is what I received. "Meredian Software Development company greatly appreciate your interest in our company.

I don't know if it has been reported before, I thought to do it anyway.
And a WhatsApp message from a friend who knew I was looking for work. I was able to pick up that it was a joke due to the poor and inappropriate grammar and incorrect writing as well as an inappropriate email address for who they are supposed to be representing. They claim to be a call centre for cancer services set up by the Indian government. And are hiring 300-2000 people. More than likely they will have you sign paperwork with your SIN numbers and then check your computers for financial info.
They contact you and offer you a job as a customer service provider. At the beginning all seems reasonable with a job offer and contract to sign. Then they ask you to use your personal bank account for processing payments. When I said that was not an option I have not heard back from them
I've been looking for work and an email came in offering me a chance to apply for a position as an Administrative Assistant. They provided a web site with the job description. Upon first glance, I looked over some bodies. Like, how there were no phone numbers provided, physical address, and just the flow of the email. I didn't catch this at first and told them I was interested. It was the second email offering me a permanent position that really raised the flags. First, the code was changed. Administrative Assistant became Financial Administrative Assistant. Then a line in the email read  So you will receive your payments to your account online, then withdraw cash from the bank branches and buying digital funds in the specialized ATM'stub. That's a direct quote, no editing on my part. The form they attached for me to fill out required my credit card number, they also wanted proof of my identity (a photo of my driver's license, passport or state ID).
I've been applying for jobs mainly using Indeed jobs. I posted my resume for administrative assistant jobs. I was contacted via email regarding a financial administration assistant position that paid very well. It seemed like good employment. Their website looked good  etc. The job posting itself seem professional. They sent me a couple emails all about the position. Then they sent me the employment contract and in the contract they insisted I gave them my credit card  and banking info so they can deposit funds into my account, then email or call me with instructions on which ATM to go to and withdraw the funds at which time they would contact me again with further instructions as to where to send the money.  Below are the emails they sent me. Thanks for the confirmation. I've attached the "Probationary Employment Agreement" document to this email. The training period is paid and lasts 20 working days. You will find full information regarding the transition period in this document. The training period is an ideal way for us to check how responsible you are and if you have the skills we desire. Simultaneously,  this allows you an opportunity to get acquainted with the duties of Financial Administrative Assistant. The educational period is combined with training. I will provide all required training and instructions by email and phone. This is remote position. You will receive payments to your account online, then withdraw cash from the bank branches and buying digital funds in the specialized ATM's. I will coordinate with you the possibility of processing each payment within a certain time frame. Each payment is accompanied by step-by-step instructions from me. The position is competitive, so I will wait for your decision regarding this offer within 5 working days. If for any reason you can not start work within 5 working days, please let me know.

Saw a job link on Indeed, applied and was contacted. This person '' call me over the phone in regards to the job only email and now is asking to use my own account to deposit money and withdraw it to buy items and send it to the "correct department"
Company email transfer large sums of money into my account, then I withdraw money and put it into Bitcoin BTM machine located at my corner store, after one day of employment, after I gave them my driver license n bank info they sent me a email statement saying I was terminated, with no explanation and no response when ask about my pay for the 2 days of work? Scared of what may come next with them having all my government and bank information now!
He contacted by email and sent me a 4000$ to become a secret lover for 400$ a week. the caller asked me to go to different places like best buy, credit union etc and do transactions such as buy him the gift cards, wire money etc. i realized it was a trap because on the mail package that contained the 4000 items the address was: 333 York street which i immediately recognized as the former telecommunications tower which i worked for years ago.
I had received a job offer via email and indeed message. I had provided a resume with name, phone number, full address, email and no more. I was sent a second email with job details and directed to tap an application link. I ceased continued contact, did not fill out any forms and, gathered information to report the possible escape attempt. I'm am fairly certain this followed the pattern of employment fraud, and I sought to report the attempts to fraud others with jobs for banking and sensitive information.
They offer me a job as a Business Manager, by receiving a message through Indeed. I signed an online contract, which looked real and on the first day, they said that they opened a cryptocurrency wallet for me, since I would be needing to buy things for clients, but I needed to activated by going to a Bitcoin ATM and deposit $20, which I will be getting back. When I got back, they said I'll be receiving between $3000 and $5000 on my personal bank account, so I can withdraw it and then buy cryptocurrency to fill the crytocurrency wallet they created. When I asked why they couldn't transfer the company money directly if I already activated the wallet, they said that it was to avoid the cash that's charged online vs what it's been charged in a BTM machine. Then I told them I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that, so they said it was impossible for them to do it directly, even though it's company money. I'm still waiting for my $20.
This could also be considered a CryptoCurrency.  I received an email regarding a job offer from Cynthia P., she supposedly found my name and email through Indeed. At first there were a couple small story things but with work and being hired for work from home its sometimes hard to tell. I was set to start Monday and all was fine and then Tuesday came and Cynthia wanted me to go look for my closest Bitcoin ATM and  figure out how to use it as part of my training. I was thrown off because I know absolutely nothing about Bitcoin so I was hesitant and I've heard a lot about these types of stuff and everything started to add up. My last email from Cynthia P. was asking me to give my banking information so a client can send me money from me to send in Bitcoin to Cynthia, this OBVIOUSLY is a fraud and I know to never do anything like that. So I proceeded to do a bunch of research and called the company directly to find out who this person was and sure enough she doesn't work for them and is operating a shop. I'm glad I was smart enough to recognize the red flags from the beginning and never give her too much information. Hopefully this information can help someone else in the future.

Received an email from a Leslie Brocato stating she would be offering me an opportunity for a job at a full time or part time position working from home. They had a website with the business name and details looking very good. But what was suspicious was the immediate call for an interview after filling out my contract information. The phone number that called me was the exact same as the one on the website.
I was contacted by Charlie White (Senior Manager) of Yellow Star Investment Group, they deal with cryptocurrency. She wanted to recruit me as a Personal Assistant, all the documents she sent and their website (https://yellowstarinc.com/) seemed pretty big for a career and an important red flag - I never applied for the job instead they reached out to me. I initially ignored the red flags because we are just starting to adapt the cryptocurrency world, I had similar work experience and having Canada very recently opening up to the Ltd's I thought maybe this firm/start up just wants to jump on that ship real quick which I do too. Their Job Description, Application Form and employment contract seems just like one from a big, well established company but too good to be true for a start up who has no information on the internet. Basically they wanted me to send my direct deposit information and somehow cut me out of my money because when I looked up their California (). +1 308 300 7978  2545 W. 237th Street North, CA 905059) address on Google street view I found myself at a business park's parking lot and the first thing that made me click was Charlie saying they were in the process of opening up an office in Winnipeg but on their website they only missed out on a suite number for the new address (). +1 204 272 0383  201 Park Avenue, Winnipeg, MB ( ( Canada). Then on their website the Privacy and Policy button can't be clicked which always means something is wrong! I am glad I took my time to research.
I've been looking for work for months as a new Permanent Resident to Canada, and my mother in law shared a call for job applicants on Facebook. She was familiar with Adecco and recommended them as a good employer. So I reached out to the Facebook poster and was given a email address to submit my resume to. On Google Earth I was contacted by the email address adeccogroup1902@gmail.com and was asked to answer a series of simple questions. The job offered $22/hour, 25 hours per week, remote. I was given the job after 30 minutes of questions and waiting for "executives" to discuss my application. I was scared. But when they discussed sending me a check to buy equipment to get started, the situation began looking suspicious. I gave them a profile photo of myself, and my contact information--phone, address, even my deposit info for my bank account--but when they asked me for my online banking card information, insisting that their system for sending them was in maintenance, it was the final straw. I asked for another e-transfer instead, but they said that was down too. When I refused to give my banking card, they stopped asking back. The person on Google Hangouts also immediately changed from "Bob" to "Gary Sousis." As a newcomer to Canada, I have faced rental cars, and now an employment scandal, and I am very discouraged about my future here. Something needs to be done about this.
I got a random email offering me the position of Personal Assistant to a investment group, me being a naive teenager who only really cared about how much money I'd be making, "took" the job, the first day was ok, not realizing they were taking money out of my bank under the name of Apple, then the second day of "work" they wanted me to go to a tiny corner shop to get $3000 worth of it, but I needed to only have cash, this raised a red flag to me, I questioned them a lot and stated "I don't feel safe doing it", then she kept trying to pressure me into doing it, so then I called my bank they asked what info I gave them, they said that since I gave that info, they are likely trying to commit identity  theft, I did some more digging and the company doesn't exist, i did more digging on the website and found when the website was made, and who made it, the "chairman" didn't exist.
I got an e-mail from an M       from Sports Analytics. I checked the website and yes there is one, but it seems fake to me, very little information. I got a call from her, sounds very nice right from the very beginning. She has a thick accent and couldn't even place her last name properly. Said she's in Ottawa so I asked why is she looking for an assistant from Montreal? Her answer was it's an online job. And she's willing to pay $100 every two weeks. I politely declined the offer and said goodbye. Maybe it's just my instincts but I think it's fake. It's too good to be true and if the man (pretending) can't even use her name properly.....well. I was goingna go ride with it and see how long will it take before she ask me my confidential information but I don't want to waste my time and wait till she ask money, because I already know where this is going. Here's the e-mail. Dear, I am glad that you show interest in position. Thank for spending your time, it will be efficiently spent.

Contacted via Instagram DM by a private account asking me to become a Brand Ambassador for @officialherteam. Their website states that "a portion of every sales goes towards giving women the resources they need to have a bright and beautiful future." However, there is no evidence that they are making charitable donations or have any affiliation with charitable organizations. Through email, I was offered a discount code to make purchases from their website so that I could later share pictures of their products. When asked multiple times for more information on their charitable donations, the question was avoided. This company has had previous complaints about purchased products never arriving to others who have been asked to become Brand Ambassadors. I believe they are also falsely representing themselves as supporting a charity to make women more likely to purchase their products.
I was job hunting for posting in Calgary Alberta and a job listing came upon the site website. After making a profile and then trying to apply to the job, I was unable to go to the next step of applying and then realized that it was a fake posting. I then tried to log back into the site to remove my resume and contact information and continue to get an error message. The only contact provided is a generic support@peersight.com and info@peersight.com email addresses. The address for the business is also fake, it is for a new building in Toronto with no businesses listed.
They sent a job offer to my Indeeds. I found that their website is fake. They copy and paste all of the information from a real company. As soon as I found this, I declined their job offer.
Applied for a job on Indeed as a Data Entry Operator/Computer Operator for a company called 'S Choi Professional Corp.' They then texted me a few days later to say they had another position available as a remote Business Manager that they wanted me to reach out to them by email about. It said they have full-time  and  part-time positions available .  they pay $100 per week depending on that. I asked them asking more information about the company and position and they sent me the details including a list of questions for me to answer. I answered all the questions and received an offer to start a 10 day probation period with them. They sent me a link with a contract to sign to start the position without even calling me or setting up a virtual interview. I did a lot of research about their company and although they have a website and apparently they registered their company with the government (link on website) since year 2000, they don't seem to have any other online presence. They told me I will be reporting to them (The City Manager who called me) which doesn't really make any sense to me. I haven't signed the contract or responded since they sent it to me as I felt there are too many red flags. I haven't confirmed this is a deal but it seems way too risky based on the salary, title and everything else.
I received an email from a person by the name of Kiana Johnson asking me is I was still looking for employment that their PR department received my CV information from a recruiting company. She said that they were opening a new office in my area and would like me to apply for one of the jobs listed in her email. She then said I would be contacted for an interview and the position would be described to me in more detail at that point. So I did, I filled out the form she sent to me, I then received another email today saying she is pleased I decided to accept their job offer (I didn't receive a job offer from them nor did I get an interview). She is asking me to send a scanned copy of my drivers License, Health card or passport before my employment can start. Never in my life have I been asked to provide this information for employment.
I applied for jobs on Facebook and got emails from 3 different individuals to use a link to confirm an interview for today on 2/2021 at 2pm. I didn't click on the link as it looked suspicious. I entered the name in your Web site and a flood of other names showed up. The actual name that showed up in my email is AO Company Overview Canada
Two separate emails came from separate email addresses asking me to register for our interview. The emails did not seem valid as the extension was not from a valid company. Before I figured out that it was fake, I'd already given them an alternate email and phone number

Was offered a job through the indeed job website, emails were full of technical errors, address for Canada and the US are both buildings for lease, not for sports facilities. I believe they are using an actual company website, name and experience as a front for their small business. Was asked to sign offer letter and provide a picture of myself holding offer letter, either scan or take it and email back to them. I took the picture and sent it as an attachment in an email. Had one phone call from a local phone number with no ID or any form of greeting. Was on edge from that email, phone call was less than 2 minutes with horrible reception. Not sure what will happen, my start date is supposed to be Feb.8th.2021, but upon researching found out they don't exist.
I was contacted by this company for employment as a Customer Service/Assistant job. I was suppose to have an interview based on my work experience. I never got the interview, a lady with a strong German accent called and asked to check my email for the contract and hung up. The email reads: The training period will be remotely. During the training period, you will receive a salary of $ 100 per week. Read this letter carefully and do as it is written. You can download the EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT by following the link. https://sports-analytics.ca/0983csjob 1)Read carefully the EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT. 2)Print it. All in your full data. Make the date when you are ready to start. 5)Put your signature at the bottom. 6)Make a quality photo or scan and send it to me. 7)Take a single photo with a contract in your hands. This is necessary to confirm your identity (Required). In case of failure of your duties, your probation period will finish and we will terminate our agreement. But I hope to continue our future activities with you. If you have any questions, reply back and I will answer it soon. Return the answer as soon as possible Best Regards,              
The offer was sent through a local online employment website via a local company's account. Strange website. Strange phone#, strange job offer, etc..., etc...,etc..., many, many red flags.
They wanted to use my personal banking information to deposit money and give them money minus 7% for commission
The individual contacted me informing me of a  new Customer's Order Processor "  position, I received a phone call and only that was my "interview", I got the job but to finish the application I have 5 days to send my ID  and  Banking information.
I was contacted about a job position as an administrative assistant for information technologies. They asked me to follow a link and fill out some information and I'd be contacted by the manager. Next day I was contacted by the manager Rosa Beck and she said I had gotten the job. I replied and said I was interested still. She sent me an email saying I was employed for a probation period of 20 working days and that the contract was attached. In the contract it outlines that the job is accepting money into my own bank account and then doing something with it. Seemed funny to me. So I did more digging. The contract asked for my credit card number and a picture of photo I.d
I hope this will help prevent anyone else from being affected. On the surface this company seemed legitimate and I did not see anything suspicious from the start. Now I can only assume that this 'Light Media Allies' is a complete scheme designed to get people to transfer their money into their accounts so they can steal it. When I was accepted as an employee I participated in a pre-training session and I was asked several questions relating to normal customer service activities. The second day of training was when I noticed the problem. I was asked to watch a video explaining Bitcoin, which did not seem to far-fetch right away, but after providing a summary on the video I was asked to create an account where I could deposit Bitcoin. I was also asked to locate the nearest ATM where I could deposit Bitcoin. In what customer service situation would this ever be relevant? At this point I decided to cut all ties with anyone and begin the reporting process. In some odd situation where this somehow is not a case, I can still say that this so-called company needs to be investigated for ethics and practice violations.

I was hired from an established web posting on indeed.com by this company I quit my previous job I was at for 3 years for this opportunity. This company told me they would pay me back annually for office administration duties for their company. I searched their company and showed as a betting company the website didn't really give a lot of detail but because this was on indeed, I inquired more. I got a call from a lady name, who interviewed me said everything will be online due to COVID-19. So I understood, this lady asked me about using my personal account for training I told her I would never do such a thing she told me that was ok it will be office work anyway. So I got the job offer quit my previous job started with this company in 12 2021. The 1st day he asked me to send information about flights to Toronto to Calgary and provide the best flight offers, so I did. The second day she asked me to go to a copy machine and take a picture and send it to her said to know how to use the machine, so I did. Then she asked me to use my personal account again so they could send me a transfer I told her we talked about this the 1st day why are you asking me to use my personal account again, she became frantic and said would call me back. I haven't heard back from her or about the days work I did and as well the experience of being fired from my previous job. So I called company marketing, and that's when I saw this issue being raised during COVID-19, its something that is happening frequently, so overall I just want the public to know and catch these people who are doing it.
I was job searching on Indeed and I'm desperate for a job, so I pretty much applied to everything I saw. There was a job listing for "Administrative Assistant", a remote job. I thought "perfect"! Silvia Hunter, CEO of this fake company, contacted me saying I am a candidate and Rosa Becks will be backing me if I get the job. A day later Rosa offered me a paid probation period. She sent me an application and I started to fill it out  my name, my number, my address...CREDIT CARD AND BANKING INFO?? I immediately stopped. I stopped writing and looked through the "responsibilities". They were going to send me money to my personal account, and then expected me to withdraw that money from the bank, and then buy "digital funds" at specialized banks.
My family had been seriously affected by this evil organization. My husband was looking for a job on indeed and came across a posting for a fundraising assistant. He applied to the job and got a response for an phone interview. He did the phone interview with a woman named Sophie who then told him he got the job. He filled out all of the required contract information to work for the company. It all appeared to be a standard employment contract. They offered a decent wage and good benefits and he was very excited. On his second day of  legal employment,  for this company he was asked to handle some donations, they had people e-transfer directly to his personal account and then he was required to change the money into Bitcoin to  also purchase necessary supplies,  for this foundation. The same day the bank froze my husbands account and reported him for fraud. We are now being investigated for recruiting people on behalf of this same organization. Please don't call for this! Do not donate to this fake charity and don't allow them to manipulate you. We are now suffering more than ever due to this war and have lost a lot of money that we cannot pay back.
I applied for an administrative assistant position and was contacted through the Indeed app, since they don't give out your personal email information to perspective employers, I was asked to email this person back with my full name and I included my resume which has my current address and phone number. I then received an email saying that they were reviewing my qualifications and would get back to me in one to two days.  I then received an email saying I qualified for the position but I needed a man for the job and they asked if I had one,  I informed them that I did in the email I replied to. There were a few different email addresses that were in touch with me, the last of which I have included above. This is the email address from which I was told that for the initial period of 30 days (20 working days) I  would need to provide them with either my banking or credit card information so they can deposit "payments " to my account and then I was to withdraw said amount and take it to an approved ATM, from a list of items they would provide me with. It was emphasized that my account would only be used for the transition period and this was to see how fast I could process payments. I did not give them any banking or CC info and contacted you, the way as this sounded like a money making scheme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
I was looking for a job on indeed. I applied for one that I know I was not qualified for. I applied again. I received a email that after reviewing my resume they wanted to offer me the job. I was excited to hear back and called right away with my phone number to discuss details. No call. 3 days later I got another email from the same person. They said I would be perfect for a financial assistant. I thought it was strange because I had no previous experience with any financial institution. I went onto their website and it seemed that however I started looking for small details. All of their contact information was all the same phone number and email. I went ahead to see how to finish the application and it wanted only my personal information. I almost fell for it because I am so desperate for a job.
Received another e-mail from a company of a position and if interested, reply.  I did and asked for job description.  I was sent one along with a Job Application Form to fill out, of which I did.  Was then sent a "Labour Contract" to start immediately.  I did not fill out the contract as I wanted to do more digging into the company - this was too easy and something felt 'off'.  I then read how it was a dream and now feel incredibly stupid, but am letting others know so that they don't give any personal information.  They did get my home address and my Rum sum card, but that's easy to find.  However, I did sign my name to state that the information was true.  I will be speaking with authorities during office hours tomorrow as well as my bank in case someone tries to apply for credit of any kind. The website does not exist, and the address shows an empty building.
I got an email from a different company saying that there partner was interested in offering me a job. It was close to Christmas and any extra money coming in would be great so I replied to the attached email. The company then gave me information about the position Got me to e sign some documents (a temporary 10 day trial period) Then sent me an email about what they do and how they use cryptocurrency. That was when a flag went up I never heard of that before. So I talked to my dad and husband. They both told me to do some digging. I found out the number when reverse looked up says it belongs to a different business but when I call it is a very simple automated voice. Then I checked the address they had listed it was for a office building but not there's. I kept doing research and I read a story of a different woman kinda in the same situation. I didn't hear from them all weekend. Then finally today comes around and they contact me through email again At this point they know my number, email, which bank I branch with. And my address oh and of course my name. Once they send me a new email changing what they said in previous where they would set up a wallet for me to now, they will send me money to my account and want me to go exchange it to cryptocurrency then show them proof. Right then in there I hopped out of bed replied I was no longer interested that I am content with what I am doing currently (because more money isn't everything) And then drove to police station to let them know. They told me I was right to be smart and good I didn't give them any banking info or continue with giving them any more information or taking money. I got lucky I realized things when I did.
I applied to an administrative position and was called back with a payment package. In the package they asked for me to give them my credit card number and banking institution. They said it was for them to send me money and for me o then go to a bank and take it out.... it all just didn't make any sense to me. With some more digging I figured out they are a money making team.
I was looking for employment on Indeed and came across an Administrative Assistant position. I applied with my resume and received an email from them offering me a job. The position is remote and would require me to receive payments online to my personal bank account or credit card and then withdraw the payment from the bank and buy digital funds at a specialized ATM.

THEY ARE IN ME EVERYDAY WITH A. JOB
This company has the exact same phone number and website set-up as another company known for being a fraud. They also tell you that for the probation period you will be handling customers money but we will be using our own personal account to handle the money. They barely ask any questions in the interview and tell you everything will be done by mail.. it is clearly a.
Hi I applied for a job through indeed and received an email for an interview and after doing some research and calling the company I found many names on their website, spoke to a person with a 417 Nevada area code, even though the business was located in Vaughan. I did a search of their business registration license and the business was incorporated a month ago and when asking the owner how long they have been in business she said over a year. I told her I saw their incorporation license and named the 2 people listed and she hung up on me immediately. here are the incorporation details I found that caused her to end the call - https://opencorporates.com/companies/ca/12463016
They found my resume on a job site and contacted me. Offering me a customer service job working from home. Paying $24/hour plus 5% commission. But they wanted me to use my personal bank account for a probation period to receive e-money transfer from customers then they would set up BTC account Bitcoin. They move money this way by hiring people fast using their personal bank accounts. As soon as I read that I knew it was a dream.
I answered an ad for a job posted by BeMo Academic Consulting. A female named Jennifer responded back to me. Her email does not indicate her last name. She told me I've been selected to  participate in the application process but before I do, I must agree to a confidential and non-disclosure agreement. Being that I am actively searching for employment, I agreed. The position was for a Content Developer and encompassed writing, shooting  and  editing videos and writing content for their blog. This seemed like a great opportunity and something that I could do remotely from home. After agreeing to the Confidentiality and non-disclosure statement, Jennifer sent me instructions for creating a video and writing a blog post as part of the application process. I was told I had two business days to complete it, however without sufficient quality, I spent an entire weekend and all of Sunday completing the requested tasks. Something didn't feel right so started to look for reviews of the company. I was first met with only 5 star positive reviews. This too didn't seem right that a company would have only 5 star reviews and not one 'con' review. I started digging deeper and searched out reviews for BeMo's 'hiring process' and that is when I found a lot of comments from people who have experienced similar situations. Are they trying to get people to write and produce content and other work for them without actually paying anyone? I'm  not sure exactly but I am not the only one feeling this way. One posting I came across was from an individual who had made it far into the hiring process. He was warning others because after a lot of hard work to meet their requests, they told him the company charges applicants money for training. Sounds like a plan to me. I am reading a copy of the email correspondence I have had with Jennifer - BeMo Academic Consulting. Thank you for your attention to this!

I received an email (with text) from a Mr server saying if I was still interested in a Payment Transaction Manager position to immediately let them know. I replied yes, please send me some additional information I checked their website I checked government of Canada site (they are incorporated) in early 2020 I checked the street view (head office was a house ) Seattle was a business building Received a link to apply- I completed but it was one item they only wanted and that was the last place I worked (not entire work history) Received a phone call 289 902-0667 and when I tried to call it back it said  your client ID is not available at this moment but  same with the Seattle number I received another call from Leya saying I did not answer her call so I asked for her phone number so I could call her as it appears as though her phone is not accepting calls She called me back and said they work from a call centre. I said I did have more questions and she said I would be given the name of a manager once I completed the paperwork Paperwork arrived - electronic signed by a Keith Doner as Chief Executive Well - off to be : did not appear in my search Keith did not appear in my search In the incorporation papers it stated logistics but when I dug deeper they could only use cars - not the semi trucks, ships or trains that appear on their website! Red flags everywhere!  This is a way I am going to contact the police in Brampton, Ontario If anyone else received an email / phone message I suggest you also document and DO NOT complete that paperwork! Even my offer letter had red flags No start date - it was left blank They could fire me at any time within the first five days (so my guess is that is when they have their  last urgent -  finance matter like the other people have spoken of where they get you to accept a payment and then send them the money!) flag!!!!!!!
BEWARE, this company is a bank.   They have changed their phone numbers 3 times since then.   Their website claims to be based in Montreal at a fake address (office tower). The last 2 phone numbers were based in Quebec City, Illinois USA.....now Missouri, USA.    If you call the numbers, you 'n't get an answer.    They are sending out fake employment offers the catch being you must process company payments through your personal bank account minus a 5% fee.   NO company would ask their employees to process payments from their customers with their personal bank account. Research this company on BBB, there is also a complaint involving corruption.

I applied for a job on indeed with the company Aboval Consulting group, it was for a call center, with better than decent pay given current times. I was contacted by another company Delta Cryptocurrency Investment LTD claiming that the original position I applied for isn't available anymore but they have a better position for me as an online reader. I haven't ever dealt with anything like that before but these people basically were willing to hire me without seeing me at all, not even a phone call. When I asked about they said that once I'm done signing the contract and agree to work with them that then I you ll be able to connect with my would be superiors. Also it was written in the job description that my daily tasks would consist of me using my personal bank account to move and send money to their  new clients too. Through this time I spoke with 2 people Cordelia Robinson, she claimed she was the new assistant, I spoke with Luke Enderson who didn't mention what his title was at all but I gathered that he is supposed to be some type of manager and all the while I had the emails from these 2 people in my mind I was later contacted by ANOTHER one of their workers on indeed by the name of Deborah Filtz asking me to send in my resume for that very same position. I should also include that none of these people can be found on any business platform (i.e e...) and no information as to the main office location that I  knew would be now  working at was ever disclosed no matter how I asked. They claimed that because of this the office is closed so she didn't feel the need to share that info even though at this point they were asking me to sign the contract. I you m able to provide and written proof should you need it.
I wanted to report a business case that I came in contact with through Indeed. The business was called Global Solutions Service and someone going by the name Samantha Carlone and then Daniela Lorenz contacted me several times through email about a job position. Without ever having spoken to a real person, they offered me a job as a Financial Administrative Assistant. The position was remote and their last email included paperwork to collect personal information, including my banking information, which they said was necessary for the position so I could process transactions for them. In the email, which were all seemingly automated, there was no address associated with the business, or contact information outside their email. Their website seems very good, which was most convincing for me, because it looked professionally done and included phone numbers for contact.
A lady named amber dragon contacted me. False company. She got my drivers license and bank info for eclipse transport. Erased all history through the app of conversations right after I called the person out on time. Websites deleted  I was offered a job and quickly I realized it was a shame by the physical nature of it
I was contacted by a person identifying themselves as Reaven S      claiming to be from the Sumitomo Corporation for the position of Data Entry Clerk. Caller claimed they selected my resume from a management applicant stack. Caller then directed me to local again for a job section process. I was given some more questions regarding the position and finally with a long pause was offered a position with the company in question. Next i was instructed to "report back online" at 8 am the following day to speak to the IT team. to which i did not as i was already suspicious. Finally the next day after intentionally missing the deadline set by the Google Hangouts caller i was sent a "offer and agreement letter " Asking for personal information and account information. At this point i confirmed this was indeed a    .
I was contacted by a lady by the name of Kim about a remote position within this company. She said their company buy domains and sells using their accounts. She asked me this morning to go to a bank to deposit, and they would go forward with giving me other tasks. But I found an article online from the news of someone with a similar experience. As soon as I heard that I needed to deposit money I knew would be a lie.
told me to do an interview over the phone. caller was from Alberta. His manager is from Ontario. asked for personal identification and to sign a labor contract. then they got me to download a mobile app "Hello". told me to alter my personal bank settings.
The J     called from indeed as the crystal dawn and then named as news network Canada at first it was a customer service representative role after I did the e-sign I got another email talking about Bitcoin and how they will send me money to trade with it for the apparent customer and they have my address and signature only. I asked to do a phone interview or some conference call and I was completely ignored about it. Pay was too good to be true
On December 5, 2020, I applied for the position of Administrative Assistant at a company by the name of Meyer Industries based out of Germany. I initially found their job posting on LinkedIn.com, and was directed to ZipRecruiter.com, another job listing site, where I uploaded my resume to them. On November 6, I was contacted by "Karry Steinier, Head of HR Department (hr@duden.ca)" asking if I was still interested in the position. On November 9 at 9 AM, I received an email from ZipRecruiter that the job posting has been closed. I hadn't responded to the previous email yet and decided to follow-up with them to see if the position was already filled, saying that I am still very much interested. On the following day on November 10, I was offered a job offer to sign before the interview. This seemed out of the ordinary but the email said the signature is a moment before the interview so I read the job offer, which seemed great, and sent the signed copy back to them on November 12. I heard back from them the same day and was told that I will be contacted by their manager for an interview. On November 16 around 1 PM, I received a call from a number from Edmonton, Alberta (7809132852). When I picked up, a man called "Bill" from Green Airport wanted to have an interview with me. I thought it was odd that they didn't schedule a time with me prior to the actual interview but proceeded with it. We talked for about 20 minutes and he said that he would be in touch with me shortly in regards to the application. Almost 2 weeks later on November 27, I received an email from  the Karry,  again saying that my application has been approved. The email contained an Employment Agreement Form and a Visa Form that they asked to sign and return, along with a copy of my photo ID. I was excited that I got the job, got overly excited and returned the signed forms along with a copy of my Ontario Photo ID on November 28. The email didn't have the Job Offer Letter attached to it, and I only thought of re-reading it after sending back the forms. That as s when I realized that a part of the letter seemed blank where it said  " Your company will present you with a credit card for payment operations (5-7 working days). During the probation period, you will be able to receive money in your bank account from our accountants. It seemed strange that my personal bank account was to be involved in company transactions, and I offered the job offer to a friend of mine who is a doctor. He helped me look into the matter and did some research to figure out that this is a case. On their page (www.duden.ca), the links to Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest did not work nor the phone number listed on the website. All the job openings on multiple employment websites had disappeared as well. That as s when I realized I had given out my personal information  and  SIN number on the Mail Form and the information on my Photo ID  card  to a stranger. At 10 AM on November 30, I received another email from . Karry was  congratulating me for joining their team. It said that my direct head is Purchasing Manager . Hailey Errington (purchase@duden.ca) To  and to contact her to let her know when I can get started and that she will give me all the necessary documents for work. I have not responded to the last email and called the police to see if I can file a report but was told that can only happen if monetary loss has occurred, and was advised to avoid further contact with them. While I haven't lost any money as I didn't actually start working for them, and although it looks like their ultimate motive was to use me for their fake drug card rather than steal my personal information, I also m concerned it may be true now that they have access to it. Then, looking through the emails again, I noticed there was another name  like Voss Moebel,  written next to Karry Steinier's name, which could only be found in the very first email she sent. I found out that there is an identical website under that name (www.vmoebel.ca) claiming to be a small business with offices in Canada (Quebec) as well as in the US (Nevada). Voss Moebel should be investigated alongside Duden.
They reached out to me online (email) advised they saw my profile online  and  wanted to see if i was interested in their ad for a payment card. position. it was of interest so I contacted them  and  away it went. I was to have an phone interview which was very short  and  did not ask the usual - type questions but it seemed ok.  Following that I rec'd an email with the employment agency  and  I had 5 days to sign  my  ; or the offer would be cancelled- that seemed standard. I sent in the papers at the end of the week  On  the following Monday I was sent an email asking that I download the telegraph app as that is how they communicate. I realized it was a what was when they asked me to handle some urgent banking matter- and this was an hour. into my senior period. Such a task was never mentioned in the duties it would be home based. Part of the urgent banking matter request: was that after I rec'd a  deposit of money to my account - than I was to w/d the money- put the money to counter agent wallet through to atm- than scan the account to them. i told them i would not handle this task and asked a few more questions- that they answered-  and  were short responses not quite complete. I stopped communicating after coming into the training period  and  nothing from them either. Never did receive an actual phone call from this -H-agent either. so I contacted my bank person  and  let him know what had happened so he could freeze my account.
A friend of mine in India's brother got offered a job here and things didn't add up. I did some research and went to the Advisor.com and definitely a blog. Fake Job offer asking the person to pay for his own flight and Visa and they would believe him. People are desperate for jobs during this time and this is very low. Lots of this and the About information was stolen from another company's website. I don't believe he lost money yet and I am very glad my friend/colleague reached out to me.                                                                                                                                                                
Reporting as online as as it looks to do to be true and all conversation done via email cannot reach by phone
The process went rather quickly, all within 1 week.     Received an email from Melissa Henderson, LLC stating my resume had been forward to them and thought I would be a great applicant for their company which is a logistics company which was seeking a Customer Care Representative to process payments forms. heir clients and deposit into their corporate bank account.   I was rewarded with a job description and website to review, which at first glance seemed easy - until I examined the mall things.  The company address was of an office tower with no suite or postal code, phone number listed on website was a USA number (Florida) - no one ever picked up when asked,  few spelling/grammar on the website in their "customer feedback: reviews and the Links didn't work. I had a phone interview with someone whom didn't speak so well,  no aspects of my resume were asked/reviewed.  Was asked 2 questions on why I would be a better client...then proceeded to tell me the jobs aspects where I would work from home online, I had to text my boss when I went and returned form breaks, I would for the first 2 weeks, process payments into my personal bank account then forward to the corporate account for "study purposes".  I was then told I pre qualified for hiring and would be sent contract.
i was contacted and asked to move money from one account to another and was promised a 5% bonus forever transaction 1. The customer will send you a payment through the online e-transfer system. 2. I will send you the task with all instructions. 3. After you receive an email from her in your e-mail, you need to deposit the payment to your account. As I wrote to you earlier, you will work with a corporate account and during your probation period you need to complete the task from your account in order not make mistakes. 4. When the payment from our customer  is in your bank account, you need to go to the bank and withdraw 95%. (5% is yours bonus for the completed task from our customer. with each transaction from our customer). 5. Then I will provide you the nearest address  Bitcoin ATM, in which you will need to send 95% to the counter-agent through bar-code. (I'll provide instructions when you are there). P/s. Since our company is closed, you cannot pass information to third parties, as this is confidential information. During your probation period, I will be your personal manager. You will receive detailed instructions and step by step to complete this task. Thus, the process of executing your tasks will not give you problems
so i got an offer of employment letter from this company and training was supposed to start this day, it was an online class with myself and 24 others. we filled out employment forms and banking info. I have heard nothing else since about the rest of my training. Its a work at home position, don't sign up.
I was asked to write a job reference for someone I know, the job being offered looked suspect so I looked into it further and confident it is a secret.
They target you by responding to your job application on Indeed. They hire you, go through a fake orientation. They then send you an insurance transfer or pay money into your personal account. They then send you to their machine at                        the The Last Stand shop. You then deposit the cash, and then send it to a card code they give you.
This individual contacted me via email saying they saw my resume on Indeed.com and thought I would be a good fit for their company.  attached to the email was a job description saying it was for "Customer Care" which consisted of transferring funds from international account to local account.  For this they offered $1200/week for full time employment or $600/week for part time.  There was also a job application attached to the email. This seems like a money making situation that can make me liable if something is unlawful.  Seems to good to be true and sends red flags up.
This company was listed on the website Zip Recruiter looking to hire workers in North Vancouver, Coquitlam, Vancouver, and Toronto. I applied as I already work in Chicago and was looking for another office position. The morning after my application they called me for a phone interview from a Toronto number. I spoke to a woman, she told me she was calling for a pre-screening interview and asked about my childhood experience, where I was born,  my age, and if I was a student. She also asked if I had a criminal record check, I told her mine was over a year old so I would need a new one. She said I could get a new one for the final in-person interview and that she would email me to set up that interview. Minutes later I received an email with a different phone number than the one I was just called by even though the caller had said she would be calling me. The email said that I was hired and would have a profile put on the website shortly. The email also said the company was BBB accredited and had a company address 538 W 24th street, Vancouver, BC,1. I thought it was very strange they would hire me this quickly as I have been hired for this type of position before and when you work with kids you need to be thoroughly tested. I looked up their business on the map and saw that they were not accredited. They also had a separate business address listed 2417 89 Nelson St  Vancouver, BC :7. I went to their website tinyhugs.net (the same website that their hiring email used) and saw a third company address listed 70 Yorkville Ave., Block #2, Toronto, ONT, #1, Email: nanny@tinyhugs.net with a third phone number for their office different than the fourth phone number on the new website. I went to their Facebook page which has forty-odd reviews all written between August and September, all of the reviewers had accounts from random cities in the states, all with less than fifty (some even had zero) friends. All the reviews had weird names as if they were written by him and there were no posts for the month of October. The Tiny Hugs BBB profile was created in 2007 as was the document they sent me regarding my new contractor terms yet most of the views were written a month before this before they appeared to even be a company. On their website, there were only six women listed as winners. A Google image search of the photos of these women all traced back to stock photos most from the same stock photo site. My friend called the phone number listed on the site and a woman answered and said that she was no longer a model for the service but could pass her information on to some girls she knows she'd love. This number was supposed to be to the Tiny Hugs matching service that would give families the profile of three kids that they could have phone interviews with. Today September 3, 2020, one day after I received the phone interview I was offered a position for an Asian family in North Vancouver who wanted an entire live-out and to care for their ten-month-old five days a week. This email was from the same email account with a different address and a fifth phone number 538 W 24th street, Vancouver, BC,, Canada. I looked up this last name in North Vancouver's Yellow Pages and found a man who has no children that clearly would not be looking for a man. During my phone interview, I said I wanted a few hours as I was a student and that I couldn't start until next month and had never worked with children under two. Yet they gave me the listing for a position starting soon with an age group I had never worked with and far more hours than I requested. Address break down: The address on the website is for a vacant apartment in Toronto currently available for lease. The address on the BBB is for a unit in the apartment building 'The Arc' in Vancouver. The address in the email they sent me is for an empty lot in Vancouver. Conclusion: None of the three office addresses are currently owned by Tiny Hugs.
I was contacted out of the blue via email by someone claiming to have a received my email address from Indeed.com as I am currently looking for a job. She said I could work from home processing payments for their company. The pay rate was $23/. +7% commission on each transaction. All I was required to do was fill out the application from with my personal information, and then complete 1-2 initial transactions within the 90 probation period. These transactions were to be done using my personal bank account for "training purposes", and after that a corporate account would allegedly be provided to me. The premise was that clients of the company cannot pay the company directly - for a reason the contact was unable to explain to me - so they deposit funds in my account, and then I send to payment on to the company, less my 7% commission. Seems so simple - too good to be true - and extremely important. The phone number on the contact's email signature, as well as the 'company website' does not work. This seems highly likely to be a money losing front or something.
I received a private message on indeed from a  Miss Nancy Howard about  offering a job for administrative assistant at a company called a Nancy Howard. The message supplied the hourly wage $24/hour and job duties. Upon meeting with interest, I received the below email with a link to apply for this position. The company however is now called international solutions group, and the website does look good, but has a lack of detailed information. Especially for a company that claims to do business with Chanel, Audi, Net arse and other high profile companies. I ran their domain through who.is and the domain isn't that old or established. Also ran their domain on the main site and nothing is coming up for the domain being registered in Japan at the moment. I called the number listed on the website multiple times, but there was no answer and after a min or so you get the option to leave a job. There is only one number to contact for everything including tech support, help desk, sales office, and service desk. My gut tells me this is a car and it takes all the boxes. I never went further to provide any personal information to them aside from my email (which I have marked their emails as such). I do believe that if I had continued with this, I would be asked for bank information and other personal info that would be used to help me. It shouldn't be this hard to find information on a company these days, including an address of their head office or a business number.
I work at                        (in       ) and a client of mine applied online for a Disability Insurance Sales position with Combined Insurance without my support.  The client was contacted for an interview and then was told he would need to pay them $35 to conduct an Alberta background check and that he would also need to complete a State Criminal Record Check.  The client was also told he would need to pay $125 to get his insurance sales license before he would be able to complete two weeks of training.                        has a partnership with the        Police Service and                        to cover the costs of criminal record checks that are required by an employer in order for clients to begin employment.  A letter of offer is required by                      , before the client can go to        Police Services for a record check. The client did not receive a letter of offer for the Disability Insurance Sales position, so I obtained the client's written consent to contact the person from Combined Insurance he had been corresponding with.  The contact's name is Cheryl Millner and her email address is: cher402@gmail.com.  I found it odd that she did not have an email address with Combined Insurance in the domain name, and that, in any of the correspondence she sent the client, she did not have a professional email signature with the company's contact information.  I called Cheryl to request that a letter of offer be prepared for the client so the client could access employment supports for a record check through        .  Cheryl did not reply to me, but eventually got back to the client saying she is unable to prepare a letter of offer.  The client said Cheryl said something along the lines of, "she didn't want to bother their head office with the request."  Cheryl had also told the client in previous correspondence that everyone who works for Combined Insurance is contracted so there is no centralized office. I called the email address Cheryl provided the client and the results came back for a mobile styling salon called "Bare Skin," in Red Deer, Alberta. I advised the client against pursuing employment with Combined Insurance, due to the aforementioned concerns.
This company contacted me through email to offer a job. I was suspect when the email came with a different company name on the from and to section. They offer you and incredible job offer that just seems too good, they are getting better though they give you a laptop, phone, benefits sounds great. Until you see that their are mistakes in the contract. There are questionable statements about bank accounts and cryptocurrency. I received a call from them and they give very little information but they give you documents right away to your account. I looked them up and their is no charity registered in the US and at their email address they use. When they call it will show the right phone number from the site which makes it even more surprising and easy to      ask people. The way they do this creates the false sense that hey they are not asking me for money and they want to pay me so this is good.                                                            
Go fit is a nutrition fitness coaching program that is based in Toronto and promises to give you a certificate once you complete their program which you must $150 for. After you complete their program they promise to give you clients using their app and you are able to make up to $800 a month. After completing the course and writing the final exam in October 10, 2020 I was promised to know my results within 5 business days. After a week has passed I email the company multiple times with no response. After two weeks of continuous emails I realize the website is no longer available and the email address is now invalid. There is no information whatsoever regarding the company and what has become of it. The only information I found is on a forum that gave the company 4.7 star ratings but all of which seemed to be illegitimate. Most reviews I came across said it was a game and it took their money and real coached never got paid. It seems they have run off with their money and did not contact anyone. After researching the company it is noted it did not date back any further than late 2019 but claims to be up since 2008.

Last week I was contacted by a woman that calls herself "Jenny". She said they were hiring for social services. So, this is running different programs for people that are super busy with their lives or unable to do so. So, they sent me a website link: www.chameleonconcirgeservices.com I opened it  and  sure thing looked like. However, the next day the website was unavailable. I even asked her if the company was BBB approved, Of course she said yes.  By  looking into it they were nowhere to be found. I was still very curious about what these bunch of women were where up to so I played along. The next day they actually sent me a fake bank draft by email for the amount of $9600 of which I was to take out $4900 to start running the bank. I then contacted her via text  and  said i had the money. Next day she was really trying to get a hold of me  and  I said I was out running my own cars in public transit. She said I was putting me  and  her at risk because I had company funds  and  threatened to call the police. As i wasn't taking any calls she decided to use the Edmonton none emergency police line by ignoring it. I also did not pick that up. I then called the number back  and  it was actually the police number .  the officer said he of any number  and  no one had called me from their station. And because of his .  the lack of a personal vehicle, I was supposed to take an offer which they would buy for the week at $150. As for the pay, it would be $300 per person. I was then instructed to make sure my phone was fully charged  and  I was available on the app called "Amazon" where her "assistant", would send me instructions for the weekend. So, Bill sent me an address which was at the waves coffee shop by the Palliser. I then pretended I was there  and  called back. She then started asking what machines I could see in the shop. In the meantime, Lilly was supposed to send me a card which she did but I missed it so I was on the phone with Jack. So, I asked Clancy what I was going to do, she said we would be paying a bill. So, this bill was being paid by the ticket machine in Palliser. At that point I lost my cool  and  started to curse her out  and  she hang up because she knew they had been busy. Mom quickly blocked me from saying not before me telling her they were good but not the best. Player's number: +12269612097 Kelly's number: +15196942776 Please put this story out in the public so that everyone knows there's a bunch of women here trying to put people in more debt. I have all the emails  and  texts messages to show as proof. Feel free to contact me for more information or if you need clarity on anything.
Received two emails the first was from someone named Linda Adam's claiming that I could move forward with the hiring process once I filled out an online application. That seemed extremely vague in the first place. After several day I received another email from a Maria Manner saying that I had been accepted for a candidate position as an administrative assistant and to fill out all the paper work to start. In the paper work it asked not for any banking information or other normal paperwork to start a job, but for a credit card number and email to e-transfer funds. They also asked for a picture of either my license, passport, or ID. In the second email manner explained that the job included obtaining deposits from different bank branches and moving the funds around.
Dear Better Business Bureau: I have been looking for a Job and applying for lots I can not even remember. I ca- remember that I have applied for a position for a  Quality Inspector. This morning I received a Job offer from kevin.tang@bizpremiumservices.com Indeed the offer was too good to be true. I was excited but something about it was not sitting right. The only phone call I received was from the  +1 778 817 1299  a Lady with an Eastern accent that spoke extremely fast and was rude didn't had a good customer service to begin and was not represent the core values they stand up for. After they ask me to filled and Employment Application form which I did not been suspicious enough I started to have more doubts. I got the Company web address and he informed me this could be a trap. So went to CANADA'SBUSINESS REGISTRIES and in fact there was no results for this company. I also spoke with a friend of mine and she recommend to file a complaint. Its not nice what this people are doing  taking advantage of this hard times where we are in need to find Jobs. Not cool to give false hopes to people. Thank you for your attention

I was contacted by this company via personal email regarding a job opportunity for a Payment Operator and that they had part time and full time positions available.  The email I received indicated that I was selected as a preferred applicant for the position. I replied to the email providing my resume and indicated I was interested in the position, an interview time was set.  As I waited for the interview I reviewed their company website which looks very good.  This company is supposed to be responsible for logistics for transportation via land, air and sea to which there are loads of regulations that need to be in place. I received the interview call this morning October 20, 2020, I had lots of questions for the interview.  The first question I asked was for more details on the position and how training was set up.  The answer that I was provided with was that there would be a 10 day training period in which I would have to use my own personal bank account to complete company transactions.  Straight away I had alarm bells going off so I told the police that I wasn't comfortable using my own personal account for corporate transactions

I entered an agreement with the shop owner,                    to complete a tattoo apprenticeship program which would take a six-month period of free labor and was charged $3500.  At the end of the apprenticeship, I was assured full time employment.  At the very conclusion of my apprenticeship, my employer fired me without compensation or any of the original $ back, and most importantly, only with criminal intent (she said my lifelong battle with mild mental illness was a weakness and that I wasn't welcome at the store until I was cured). This in itself seemed a cut and dry case of discrimination with the Alberta labor standards and Human Rights, however, due to the fact that she never technically 'employed' me, there's very little the ALS could do for compensation of a wasted 6 months of income, plus the assurance of subsequent income as an artist in her shop.  I am currently trying to resolve this issue with AHR, however, they are having problems managing the company, because it seems the business is no longer registered.  So while my initial intent was to simply try to recover my losses, however, with information I learned while working there - nothing but cash transactions with clients and payment to staff.  Cash only.  This registered as a red flag at the time, but I was hoping to get a job there, so wasn't in a position to question the ethics of that sort of payment, but I had always heard that cash deals were usually associated with this business and in an attempt to                                                   buy  Then I heard about her company being registered as dissolved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Classic      ones where they send you some paperwork to fill out promising employment. There is no person or the company with that name on Linkedin or regular Google search
I received an email about a job offer, saying that my resume had been found online without actually applying to the company. I followed up with the email agreeing to an interview and requesting more information, but I had second thoughts and did research on the company (IGLeaders). I could not find them on Google, LinkedIn, Indeed or Not. I found one website ( igleaders.ca ) that reported to be down for maintenance. They provided the lists of companies they claimed to work with, but I couldn't find any partnership information on those websites. The only company that came up with a similar name is one that works with Instagram, and IGLeaders on their one website claims to work with international students. I followed up with an email saying that I was declining their offer. They still sent me an application, contract and vague job description information. On this paperwork it said Independent Global Leaders, which also came up with zero results when looking. None of the paperwork provided described what the company was. They claim to be based in Saskatoon and opening a new office in Ottawa. I asked them for location details and they couldn't provide that. This could be a big company with poor recruiting skills, but I couldn't find anything that can be verified. To me this looks like other employment terms I've read about online.
Contacted saying he had an offer of employment as an Accounts Receivable agent.  Offer too good to be true, especially   for someone with no experience.
I have received a job offer through an email that has claimed that they saw my resume on indeed site. They offered a job without even one interview! they asked me for my home address and when I accepted the job which was supposed to be an online service manager, the person asked me for my bank account information to send me money for buying it!!! I mean they even didn't know me and we didn't even talk for a minute!!! Of course, I refused to do so and withdraw my employee application.
An out of the blue job offer made me research this a little and found it very funny.  The business is incorporated and listed under Ayan Rowe of Scarborough, ON.   Initially, it appeared as usual, but as I'm actively searching for employment and it's a desperate time to be looking with the public, I didn't want to miss an opportunity.  After one exchange via email and some online digging I realized I was being stalked.

I was saved by these people offering me a position with the Company as an Operations Manager and would be making $43/hour. I have not filled anything out that they have sent me or sent it back. They are wanting me to send back a void check to my account and an employment agreement according to English law.
I applied for a job, they sent me an application along with asking for my banking info as I would have to deposit money into my personal account and then transfer to theirs..... RED FLAG
They offered me a job making $43/hour to be an Operations manager. did the training and found out they wanted to send me an order and go to the bank and withdrawal it and go to a certain bank and send it to someone in town. fell asleep during the training(having a 10 month old baby is hard work) and woke up to a random offer of $2950. Was a fake letter and now I owe the bank $2950 and have a fraud notice on my account because of these sorry sacks of.......

I was called by Melanie Plett, a supposed buyer for a Logistics company (Wrangler Logistics) based out of Winnipeg, asking my interest in an available role they had for a Customer Order Processor. Melanie's email correspondence was brief  and  vague, and the website itself generic and lacking any detail or depth, so I was immediately suspicious but continued cautiously - I was then asked to formally submit an application online, which I did via https://wranglerlogistics.ca/application.php. After that, Melaine called again to confirm my application and set up an interview very quickly, which I agreed to. She called at the agreed time and her approach was immediately suspect - she asked 3 standard interview questions but clearly paid very little attention to my actual answers, and hurried through each one. I seemed to have passed the interview already, because I was then told I would be on a two-week probation period under the guidance of a manager. I was then told, "After this period we will allow you a company bank account, but during this time you're required to process client orders through your own bank account" At this point I stopped her because I wasn't sure of the full system, but I know it's illegal for companies to process their finances through employees personal bank account - so this front is either gaining access to private bank accounts or is somehow running money through them? I told Melanie I wasn't willing to use my own account for company business and she said ok, if I change my mind let her know. That's all of the correspondence we have.
I applied for this job on indeed and they responded to me. The benefits seemed to be a amazing. I started looking into things as I spoke with he manager. There is no information about this company even though it's been around since 1999 they said. The CIA director never had a phone number attached to her emails. The address provided doesn't work for actual Google maps even off their web page and its inbox. When looking on LinkedIn information is few and far between, not sure if her profile was fake. Biggest worry is they want to pay in return but don't tell you this till after you sign the probation contract. They promise so much money weekly pay in the beginning. Lots of red flags for this company. Asked them to call me today to discuss but no phone call so I withdrew my consent and application from them.
I was initially contacted by this "company" out of nowhere. Did not contact me from any of the job searching sites (i.e Indeed, etc.) to offer me a position within their company. After mentioning that I am interested, I got a call from them for a 5-10 minute phone interview. Which was following by a job offer to work from home, asking for banking info, and to sign documentation. Now I did my homework before signing any paperwork, or giving away any banking information. The company is nowhere to be found, on Indeed, LinkedIn, BBB, Glassdoor, or any website that would mention a workplace. I even checked the address on Google Maps to try to find the office, nothing. Also searched the names of the people who contacted me to try to find some info, the list could not be found on Google or LinkedIn. The only information on the name that I found, was that the company was dissolved in 2012. Before accepting any job offer, make sure to do your research first. I've included the initial email I received. Look out for technical errors, and also the minimal requirements needed for such a high paying job. But really, look at the email. If it says email via sendgrid.net then it is definitely a text. If anyone is sending emails through email, then it should say.com, not.net
I have been applying for remote, work from home jobs on Indeed. The day after I started applying, I got an e-mail form a "Thomass" saying "I found your profile on Indeed portal and was really impressed..." and went on to write a very professional looking e-mail including a logo, job description, salary amount and link to their website. The e-mail closed asking if I would be interested in applying for the position and to respond to her e-mail if so. I followed the link to the website and it is very well done and 100% legitimate-looking. I responded to the e-mail asking more about the job and got a fast reply with most of the same information from the first e-mail message, as well as a link to an employment agreement. The agreement was via HelloSign and looked less professional.It did not ask me for my social security number or banking information but did ask for my exact address and an electronic signature. It did include a business number: 867603623 which I looked up and it belonged to a Norstan Canada Company, however, it is based out of Winnipeg MB, not North York as it stated in both e-mail and I believe that it is a mining company not an IT company like the website and job description in the email stated. I then went back to the Website and called all of the numbers provided including sales services and tech support to which there was no answer or automated service.The company is also not registered under the BBB website which leads me to believe that it is not a legitimate company and that this is a way to obtain my SIN number and banking information. It is a shame if it is fake because It would have been my families saving grace. But things that fall into your lap and sound far too good to be true, usually are.
Offered a "Finance Manager"  job with incredible benefits and $28.50 an hour with no interview. The one phone call consisted of pressure to accept the job, download the Telegram Messenger app and refusal to share the company phone number. Was also told a Niagara Falls, Ontario warehouse was opening'soon" and the online job would turn into a bricks and mortar job. Who does this and remain an anonymous employer? Never heard from them again after a series of pointed questions was asked to them on the nature of the job, their expectations and how to can contact them. How exactly do their customers contact them when all phone numbers don't accept incoming calls? I suspect the worst with this company.
An acquaintance of mine received an email with a job offer for "Customer Service Representative" remote position with a Full time salary of CA 1000 or Part time salary of CA 500. They included detailed Roles and Responsibilities and said would provide 7 day training and make salary payment on every Friday, EST. The email was sent via "sendgrid.net" and the website http://norstan.ca was registered only on Sep-17-2020. I checked the Canada Corporations website and found a registered company by this name, but headquartered in Manitoba. I couldn't find any contact numbers to verify these details The person who contacted was "John Jones" with email "hr@norstan.ca" There is a LinkedIn profile by this name which looks to be fake as well as an organization page by this name which also looks fake. The website www.norstan.ca seems like a copy of a Montreal based company http://ingrix.com/index.html, not sure if this is also fake.
Contacted my friend for an administrative assistant job that was work from home and required no experience with a very high salary. There was no interview process. They wanted him to sign a contract and they also wanted his banking information.
I was approached by the above company for employment when I was to start my first day they told me to take money out and put it into bit coin to send to the business. They told me that they were opening an office in London so I went to the location that they indicated would be open by this time and there is no location there. when I asked the individual about this I was told they are going to rent there but at this time have not got the office as of yet.
I have been told that this is the BEST top modeling site in the world! I was told that the money I make is mine, but then when I found out via a phone call that the models only take home 20% of what they are supposed to make and the company takes 80% - that's highway robbery! Next I find out that I haven't gotten paid! I understand that they would take a cut, but not 80%! This is also NOT written on the website of the platform that they use to stream! All it says on the website is that the models / performers get a part of the amount, but NOT 20% ONLY.... Next to find out the 80% goes to OTHER models who make the top 5..... so they are using my money to buy gifts and trips to other models.... not fair..... I didn't work for free and all of the other models are getting paid, so I need my money! As per what I'm told I'm supposed to get is $434.25 US (this is my 20%), but what I actually want is my full amount that I worked those hours for, which in total comes out to $1,789.32! Not to mention the leg work to get my money, because I haven't yet received any payment from them - so my settlement that I want form them at Paradise Lost is $2500.00 US for all of this trouble. I only worked on this site to get extra money to help pay off my debts, but if I had known in advance that they take 80%, I wouldn't have applied to be a model on this site! I found out 2 weeks later (after the date that I started) that the models only get 20% of the pay! Another thing that I was told is that I could apply for direct deposit, but that's not the case - I was informed then about a wire transfer and that was supposed to happen on Saturday, and it hasn't! So, in lieu to this, I am asking for the full payment in the form of a check of $2500.00 USD so that I can get everything back that I earned! I will never bother them again after this. The person in contact is Tommy Gibbs - the second number is his cell phone number, and he says that this is his company. I want my money that's owed to me so that I can finish paying what I need to pay. Do NOT go with this site - they are not honest! They also haven't had me fill out a Tax Form for tax purposes, so he may be doing tax analysis as well. I know in the states they need to provide that.

I received the following email: My name is Melanie Plett and i am a human resource manager at Wrangler Logistics Inc. We offer you an open position in our company: Customer's Order Processor. For Part Time or Full Time options are accessible. This is a position inspection below: -Primary duties are to take care of advice from clients. Monitor files and provide feedback on level of quality. the with clients payments reporting. Requirements and abilities: -good oral and written contact, abilities for all stages of the organization. -entry level computer skills including a word. -ability to travel once in a while (only available). Our company delivers a competitive and complex deals such as: -vacation pay, paid time off -full medical coverage -career growth and opportunities -profit sharing plan Salary Estimate plus bonus deals: $26.30/h for FT   $21.80/h for PC My best to you, Melanie Plett I had a brief back and forth with this person, each time receiving a new email instead of a direct reply to my previous message. They followed up with a seemingly impressive job offer and said I fit their profile, but the job seemed to require next to no real skills and no education, while I have a masters in physics. I asked where they got my info and they ignored me the first time but the second time told me they receive info from multiple companies and couldn't tell me where. They sent me an application via their seemingly empty website (although in my own searches I was unable to find this online, and the only mention of the company was on a registry website) and the application was filled with bad grammar, although didn't ask for anything most job applications don't (and trust me, I've filled out  a lot  of job applications). All in all, I've been applying left and right for even decent entry level jobs to no avail, so an offer for somewhere I didn't apply seemed highly suspect. Everything about it was suspicious, but it took me a bit to decide with certainty it was a trap, as the whole thing was really quote well done. The email format followed standard formats with real work departments I've spoken with, the job description was in a familiar format, and the phone number, registered company address and stated address all lined up. Something about it felt off since the beginning, but it took a few emails before I was convinced it was fake
I am filing complaints against WFG insurance. I was working in a office as an agent and the owner of the company started talking to me about WFG and she told me that how I can pursue my career in it and she told me you you ll get good training and she just forced me to go for it and just cause I did not have enough knowledge I got sucked into this situation she put my name under his son's recruiting so that he will get the commission or whatever. Later she stopped coming to the office and when I try to contact her there she s no response back and I have no idea what I'mona do. I paid 146.90$ which the claim to be as registeration fee. Right after this enrollment I checked that they are fraud so many people have complaints against them. All I want is please give me my money back, I work hard for it.
Hi, I actually got a job offer from a company called CYMPA Investments Inc. Website- https://cympainvestments.com/en/contact.html for Asset Manager position. I was contacted via email for a job offer and asked to register by signing an agreement. Later, I realized that they are not available via phone and their physical address is not even coming up on some map.The agreement looked simple.
I was looking for jobs on indeed. The positions was for an  unpaid administrative assistant but  for  an or Emily Adamson. 2 days later I was contacted via indeed asking for my name and email address again. Then all the positions posts were deleted. Later I got an email to my personal email address saying it was possible for me to be accepted and my position would be for a Transactional Assistant for National Business Solutions. I started researching the company and it was a complete ghost. They provided a full website in my email but it was not really page and the the job in the link was too good to be true and seemed silly saying I would  only receive money and then  to do a task.  I'll provide a link to that job offer page as it is not connected to the business site. There is no physical address information. And no one answers the phone number listed on the site. The websites was only created according to who.is on 09/08/2020 which is the same day I applied for the job. https://nationalbusinesssolutions.ca/assistantposition
Offers employment. No interview conducted.
                wants to know if I want to collect any accounts for them. I said sure  They sent me the application nothing personal and the first account they want me to collect is for $        100 and the guy knows I am looking for him. This fellow                   cop is now wanting all my bank info birthday and three pieces of gum and wants to send me a check for $      .the killer is Saiko wants to pay me $      100 per month, with a 5% recovery fee  on $        @  5% is $         look to good to be true My question is why can't                  I Pay Saiko and they can Save $       
I was contacted by a company at random saying they found my resume online. Both emails I have received mention I need to provide a void check before I get started. However I can find no information on this company that has been in business for 5 years, which claims partnerships with major corporations in Canada. They did not specify which website they found my resume, nor can I find their company profile on any career website I have a profile with.
My resume was found from them on a website.  I had posted on several looking for employment at home.  The bank representative sent me an email offering me the job of a Business Manager.  I was eager and excited to learn something new.  I would work 40 hours a week making $1300.00 a week.   I had to first set up a wallet for          the cryptocurrency, because she assured me that this was very legal and an easy way for them to deal with customers and they made a profit.  So I worked for them for 2 days sitting talking and back and forth with my parents.  The same person's assistant called me to do an interview over the phone.  They tried on several occasions to send me $2000.00 via e-transfer but none of them were ever accepted.  I sat patiently working with this lady for 2 days from 9 to 5.  I was supposed to be wearing the $67 I used to set up the wallet.  Didn't receive a cent from them.
 Dear Sir/Lady, yes!                      He connected me through          and informing me that there is a great opportunity with his company -    Silk Energy Company Limited base in Alberta Canada as International Agent. After I submitted my resume to the email he was provided and later on his was identified himself as Mr. D. Smith, Exploration Manager of the said company. At first, I was directed to look for the manufacturing company in Southeast Asia producing Viscofluid product which I did and according to them as recommended by the Canada Association Chemicals. After that, I was advised by Mr. Stuart  to request a 20 page sample to the company in Malaysia and it will be the cost amount to $1,600 upon signing of the contract (Hard copy) in Canada. On 30 June 2020, the product had been delivered to Silk Energy Limited with postal address at Station Main,, Alberta Canada which was confirmed by Mr. Stuart. On the details and instruction, I was informed that the product has successfully conceded various laboratory tests - ISO and ISO test methods. With that, I was directed again to make available 1 Drum of Gold product to be used for the inauguration program in which I cannot afford it amounts to $16,000. At this time, I thought that it might be a fraud or any form of fraud that's why I started effort to verify the legitimacy of Silk Energy such as Business Name, Registry ID, and Office Location and it turned out to be Silk Road Energy Inc. This time I asked him why it is written with the given name, he clarified that is CUPID I don't know about it. Since I did not agreed with his answer, I asked him to avenge all the costs incurred of these transaction but not limited to i.e cost of sale of the product plus commission, office set up, 1 year payment for secretary and accountant, and health and moral damages but he replied "This will certainly make your position vulnerable".                                                                                                                          
I received an email from the company wanting to hire me as an Customer Order Processor. It is a work from home position. They had me fill out an application form then contacted me for a telephone interview. The lady I spoke to was very soft spoken and I felt like she was reading off script. She then began to tell me that there will be a 10 day probation period, during this time of working for them I will be required to use my own bank account for receiving funds then after the 10 days they will be providing me with my own corporate company bank account. They want to me to fill out a contract, provide them with my banking information as well as a copy of my driver's license. I cannot find a legitimate website for the company or any information backing the company up.
I received a job offer indicating I would make $35 per hour without an interview. When I asked for the company address they were hesitant to give it to me. I accidentally sent a file with a copy of my text to them. When I looked them up with the FBI I found out they are a team. The address on the BBB is in Denver Colorado
After applying for a job on Indeed I was contacted by a company called CCT Limited. The company claimed they wanted to hire me as an assistant manager, full time, with a pay rate of $5000 today ($3500 today) per month. I provided the company with my full name, date of birth and address in preparation for this new job. Unfortunately I later discovered through a recent article that this company is not legitimate. The company asks you to create a Fair Trading account which they can then access for their own personal purposes. The name of the person who contacted me from this company is Carla Connolly and she claims to be an IT manager. I would like to note that this company also uses a Canadian address and claims to be operational in both Canada and the United States. The postal address listed by this company is  308 E 5th Ave E, 2nd floor, Vancouver, BC, ONT2, Canada.
I had my resume on Indeed.ca, and I was contacted by this person in regards to employment. They had me fill out a form on their website including copy and present my resume, and then they conducted a short telephone interview that did not seem right because the person on the phone only asked bare bones questions (how long have I been employed, etc.). No actual questions about my qualifications. The person then advised me that my personal bank account would be used to process payments during a particular period. They have my full name, my e-mail address, my resume, and other information that I had to provide during the application.
I was searching for a job online, submitted my job application to multiple companies, yesterday I got contacted by this company via email offering me a position in their company "if I was still interested", I reviewed the information they provided and continued with the employment process. After signing the Labour Agreement contract and giving to this "company" my information they told me I was going to be on a trial period of 14 days, after day 1 of doing what I was requested on the job, they requested this procedure of funding a client's account through these common currency funds. I got stolen my information and $500 in the process. FIRST EMAIL "My name" On the job board INDEED your resume has been included in the list of candidates suitable for our new position!

The person gave me a job interview Over chat on local pages, I was hired right away. They told me to come back the next day for more info, they said they would send a team to buy products for the training. I deposited the check and they told me to buy gift cards with the money that was available with the price the gift cards would be so they can install the software I needed for training, I bought them and they asked for the code on the back which I gave them they asked me to buy more with my own money and it would be delivered through the check.
I received an email from a Samantharocca@quantumtrans.ca, a Brand Manager from Quantum Transport Inc. She shared information regarding a 100% remote job offer for an operations controller. The compensation amount offered and ability to work remote for company based in Nova Scotia, while I am living in British Columbia did not make sense. The email was also filled with spelling mistakes and bad grammar. I was also confused as to how my email address was obtained by this call manager as i don't list my email address on any of my social or networking profiles (indeed  my  ;) Wanting more information, I responded to this email advising i was interested in hearing more. (The company was impossible to find via Google, no reviews, no social media pages) and almost responded instantly with a link to a new looking website for Quantum trans, this link directed me to the fake job application where i filled in fake basic details (there was no request for a resume or cover letter within this job application) and  also reviewed about  my application and she instantly organised a phone interview for the following Monday. Sarah was an hour late to contact me for the interview and did not follow up to advise she was delayed. I attempted to phone her on phone number listed on her email signature (which exactly is the exact same number listed on the website for customer service?) The number was not real and did not connect to any body. I eventually received a call from somebody claiming to be from this company to conduct the phone interview but oddly it was not  some andr  whom i was previously corresponding with but a different hiring manager from the  same call centre guy. They had a thick accent, possibly middle eastern and i could barely understand what they were saying. They asked me two very generic interview questions, if i had experience working in operations and 3 of my skills, that was it. The call lasted only 10 minutes. They mentioned something about setting up a corporate banking account, possibly involving a fee to be paid (but her accent was so thick i did not understand) Moments later via email i received a job offer containing a fake contract from Jonathan. They wanted my ID and banking details. I asked for them to verify their business and they provided no business description. This is when communication stopped. Im sure after sending my personal details that they would Have attempted to obtain funds..
I was applying for warehouse positions and I received an email stating that I did not get the position but they had another position they offered me as a job poster for indeed.ca his name was Mavin Bickford but when he signed off at the end of the message he signed it Mavin Bedrew, seemed odd then he wanted my personal information such as full name, address, cell phone number, current occupation, who I bank with, and what email do I receive messages from. So that they could pay me either $250 a weekly or $500 bi-weekly or $1000 a month my choice and they wanted me to do it for the next 12 months as a side job. And not knowing I gave them my information and posted an ad on it and one for myself but it seemed super odd considering he always ended his sign off with your The consultant/IT manager at CI investments Inc.
This company reached out to me claiming to be offering an opportunity to become one of their brand ambassador in exchange for free jewelry, via Instagram direct marketing. This seemed unusual to me as I only had a small Twitter account, with only a few photos of me on it, most of it was of nature - an odd choice for a jewelry company. The catch seems to be that you are expected to pay for the shipping. They also explicitly stated that there was no contract, which to me seemed suspicious as that almost always benefits the company, not the owner. Once I responded to the most direct message, I was flooded with responses from the supposed "Brand Manager". Again, strangely eager. When I said "I think this is a deal", they responded with a stock message about "understanding my situation", even though I had directly accused them of being a liar and using classic "brand ambassador" sales tactics. I imagine a real brand would take great exception to being called a name and simply stop being that potential ambassador - they didn't seem to mind at all. I hope others have not been caught up in this, as even after I searched the internet for information on whether this was a lost opportunity or a trap, nothing came up. I can see how unfair this is. Thanks for your help.
I was contacted via email about a job opportunity for operations controller for a company called Quantum Transport Inc. It was listed as a remote job with a job description and application. Then I was asked to send my a void check and ID to process my earnings. They asked that the ID had the ID number and my birth date checked out. I did that signed an employment contract and then I communicated with the new trainer Samantha Rocca who said she would walk me through my training. She stated that I would need to receive between $1000 at first to my bank account during the probation period. Then I would withdraw the money and transfer the money to the company through a local ATM. I asked if it was legal and she stated yes it was but I felt uncomfortable and contacted the Better Business Bureau and they indicated more than likely this was not a legitimate practice and they had heard of similar schemes. I asked that to destroy my information and that I was uncomfortable with this as it sounded like money talking. She said she would destroy my information but I will contact my bank and passport office to ensure that my information will not be compromised.
I was contacted by the company, told they'd reviewed my profile on LinkedIn, and thought I could be a potential candidate for the job of Operations Controller (a remote position). I called back saying I'd like more information on the job and company. They sent me the website address and I checked everything out. I applied and was contacted about a phone interview for the next day. During the interview, they started off asking typical questions like "Do you have experience in this role? What was the last position you held and how long were you there for? What are your 3 biggest strengths?" Everything seemed fine until she started talking to me as if I'd already gotten the position  and  no talking it over with others, no offering it to me and letting me have the final say. Then she explained that I would be doing a two week trial reporting directly to a manager. During that two weeks, they would get me set up with a company bank account, but it would take the full two weeks so I'd be paying all expenses through my own personal bank account. I told her I was not comfortable with that, and she replied it was a requirement of the job. I made it clear this was not going to work and hung up.
The name goes by               not offering a WFHO Assistant position. She sends you the contract which asks for your address, signature and a record of you holding the contract. She asked me go to a local Bitcoin ATM take a picture and learn how to use it so her  old client you  can transfer you money to your account and then convert it to Bitcoins. I did not proceed with that last request.
I was contacted by email directly from an organization called Broadway Staffing solutions which viewed my resume on Indeed. I proceeded with the application as usual. All communication was conducted through email only. They are really not only having contact through email only. As the application proceeded I found a few things to be out of the ordinary. I immediately noticed the website was a fake especially with the photos of their personnel. I even know the website they used to obtain  photos of their so-called employees. I called the phone number provided on the application and it would go dead, not even an answering machine. I even called during their stated business hours which is 9-5 and still the line went dead. I looked up the Mississauga address provided on the application and the address appears to need a unit number for it to be valid. I was handed an employment agreement form in which case i had requested to speak to a real person. I was sent an email in response to my request which stated i have to sign the form and then Mary Patterson would reach out by phone. I replied that I would not be signing anything unless I speak with a person, specifically Mary Patterson. It's been most 2 weeks since and nobody has contacted by email or phone. According to the emails. I was communicating with Mary Patterson. I honestly believe there is no such individual. The person that was communicating with me is not a native English speaker. With a name like Mary Patterson it is highly unlikely for major statistical errors to occur. I also noticed that the website bssinc.ca was registered on a server June 17th 2020 which happens to be a whole 6 days before I was contacted for a job opening, which is strange because according the website they have been in business for the last 5 years. If they truly have been in business for that long the company would have much more of a presence on the internet. I had a hard time finding any information about the company and what they actually do as an organization. I am more than happy to send the items that were sent to me by my and solutions
illegal recruiting
Contacted me asking whether or not I was interested in their new position for Finance Manager with their company. She said that they had both full and part-time positions available. The first red flag was that in her list of requirements and abilities to be considered for the position were non-extensive for such a high up position, basically just that you had to be 19+ with administrative skills. They promised full benefits, Lots of vacation pay and life insurance. Promising above average pay at $50 an hour. I replied that I was interested so I could gather some information to determine whether it was a legitimate business or not, and she asked me in the following email to fill out an application and send it back. I was not about to give them any of my information but after extensive research online I found that it is a big story. They also had my old last name and email address so I wasn't quite sure where they even got my information from or how they knew that I was looking to change careers. I did look up the business through the CRA and there is a Golden Way transport Inc. since the 60s but they are using the name.
I am writing this complaint against one of their's offices located on 3860 Ave.  Nord-duère, Saint-Laurent, Quebec,4. I am complaining due to the following reasons : -	Violating privacy by stealing contacts lists from my personal cell phone -	Being short in the terms being used -	Lack of training or learning, unlike what was promised -	Getting new users to pay fees for apps and activities -	Forcing kids to buy financial products or sell them to their families -	Being rude if they don't comply and intimidating/recruiting access to Canada
As I was going through the list for my local buy  and  sell page on Facebook, I came across a listing for Data Entry work. The wage stated was $32/hour. I knew this was way to good to be true. The woman that listed the ad went by the name of Margaret Hamiltion. I asked her how someone would go about applying. She said that I would have to download Google Hangouts and she would refer me to the hiring manager and that I would be undergoing a question and answer session through texts via Facebook. The more questions I asked, such as which company this was for, the more upset she became. She said that it was through Adecco. I searched through the job list for Adecco. They do have data entry positions but definitely not for that pay. I decided to check the BBB site to see what kind of cars have been in my area and there were a couple that fit this situation to a tee. I have seen this same posting under different names as well. As soon as I started to ask more questions, the post was deleted.
I've been applying for jobs through Indeed and had sent a resume to an ad for a position at "Joe's Autobody Repair Ltd". The only reply I got was directing me to send my resume to another company. So I did, thinking they had used some sort of security agency for something. I was contacted by "Kayla Alexander" who sent me a long email with horrible grammar and strangely spaced sentences (see attached) which struck me as odd because her LinkedIn profile says she has a Masters degree from McGill. They were offering 1080/week CAD, for full time work and said it's a remote work from home job for a Customer Service Agent. At this point, I went to their website which lists the likes of Tim Hortons, Audi, RBC, etc as clients. I looked up their address in Google maps and it appears to be a run down mall with no office space nearby. They couldn't even be bothered to type out the full postal code. I then called the number (within "business hours") and a robotic male voice with a British accent basically gives you the run around and ultimately tells you to leave a message. By this time "Dad" had called me back with more information telling me that the probation period is basically just simple tasks used to "assess" work. There are also strict regulations about not doing any "side issues" and having to be in constant contact with the supervisor during business hours. They never interviewed me, just read my resume (presumably) and then offered me a ridiculous amount of money for what should be a minimum wage job. I've attached the screen shot of the original email reply, but I have saved the messages if needed in the future. They don't have any information other than what is on my resume, and I didn't click the link sent to me to "register".
A person who apparently worked for the company posted a job opportunity on Linkedin. I applied to  info@bruno-fratelli.com and then received confirmation to do a phone interview. I completed the whole interview and had to answer some questions within 30 minutes. Then the person started to contact me by text message which I thought was a little odd. They called me an agreement and asked for identity, bank account number and confirmation of a utility bill. As I was expecting payment I provided all of this to them including my passport. The person texted me and advised that I would be receiving funds in bank and goods shipped to me to start work (online transfer position). I never saw or heard anything and the job was supposed to start on June 15 or before. I attempted to text and call the number, however there is no answer and now no call. The whole conversation I had with the person is fine, however their messages have completely disappeared now. I have attempted to email four times now and have received no response.
I received an employment offer from this supposed company. The position needed no prior experience and the job title was vague. When I conducted a background research, I found some results but was not sure if it was this company. They had not provided me their company website in their email. I signed some contracts and agreed to work with them. They asked for my passport first page which I did not give. But sadly, I was dumb enough to give me a scanned copy of my driver's license. They suggested that I make a personal account and that is where most of the job-related communication happened after I accepted the job offer. In the job offer, I was told that this was a remote position and but I was told to focus on my first job task. They claimed that they had made some checking accounts for me and needed me to withdraw the money they sent me on my bank account. I had already visited a convenience store to "activate" my checking account by losing $20 dollars. It was after this I had to go withdraw the cash from my local TD bank after which I was instructed to deposit that money into a Bitcoin machine. I was also instructed to not tell the clerk at the bank that I was withdrawing for nothing. After I had deposited the money into the ticket machine and had the deposit, I got an email from them inviting me to call a certain number to complain that the money was not deposited. When I refused to do so, because I was being told to lie, I suspected this was all a game. After I sent the manager a reply strictly saying no, she replied in an aggressive manner and tone threatening me that this was my job and I was on my "trial period' and that I have to do this. I immediately left the place and went home. Later, I replied that I cannot continue the job while travelling as I had no transportation of my own and had to take transit. After that, they had released some money to my bank account which I refused to pay back and threatened them that I was going to report them. I did not accept the deposit in my bank account and eventually the deposited money got cancelled. After that, I did not hear back from them.
I received a job offer from them saying that they had found my resume online. They offered me a job even though I did not have any experience. The description of the role was also very vague. I also did some background research on the company and found nothing. So, I think this is completely a trap. When I replied to ask more information about the role and the company, they sent me some contracts to fill that I did not do because they asked for personal information such as my driver's license.
I applied for a job and they called me back about interview and training. I had to sign forms and take a picture with them. They called me for a small interview and then tried to jump start me into what they called training. They wanted me to accept money and transfer it into a filing machine for their clients. What started off as what seemed as awkward company meetings quickly became apparent as a money - ride. They also have you download an app for your 'training' and say the only contact we will have is through email and no other contact
The so called Web Desk contacts you offering a virtual job and provides you with an ID. You install an app called Telegram where Amanda Linfield will give you an instant telephone interview. After the so-called interview, Amanda will tell you she will speak to her hiring team and get back to you. She will then message you a few minutes later saying you got the job. Will then tell you that the company will be providing you with the funds you will be using in purchasing the software you will be working with. The check will cover all the equipment you need to start the work with. Problem is the case is where so you have now purchased all of this so-called equipment with no way of getting your money back from them.
Emilia Peterson reached out to me with multiple emails about a job offer for Customer Service Rep position at Derbens Service LLC. I requested to visit the office and meet her but she refused to do so due to Covid-19. Derbens Service is not registered on air. Google maps does not recognize their business name nor location. Other victims have been identified via             . One victim mentioned that they were asked to use their personal bank account to process company's payments.

I received an email regarding an offer of employment  however, after the manager had collected all my personal information and I sent back the signed contract, she sent instructions for withdrawing cash from a waiting ATM machine.. 
I signed up for a "marketing position" with Crazy Remote Media, who promised $300/month (paid weekly). However, after a couple of weeks with no payment to my PayPal, which I sent them the information for immediately, I followed up. They gave me the run-around for weeks, until they stopped responding to my emails altogether and have not followed up with a way to identify the missing payment. They've had access to my Facebook account for their own profit, yet have not contacted me for the access. They owe me about $450 and have yet to pay me.

They contacted me saying they saw my profile online and want to hire but there were some red flags. Asked me to fill a pre interview form, i did. They immediately sent me a link saying my contract is on the link. The link is weak and the company's website is only a month old
"Rochelle Carter HR manager" offered me a home based job as a asset manager via email. The company has no web presence except for their website. They make you sign a contract before you can speak with anyone on the phone, and before you have an interview on the phone. When you call them, you get a computerized voice on their lines. I was told not to call them, they will answer my questions via email. She stopped teasing me when I voiced my concerns.
This company reached out to me via email. They said they wanted to hire me. They claimed that they support other companies and provide tech support. And they use the second platform. I started the job by communicating with so called "Michael People" using the app Telegram after I signed a contract. She said I had to transfer out 100 to 100, convert that to one, then transfer that to a local wallet, then to the company wallet. Then they sent 3000. 2900 was then transferred out and they paid me the 100 dollars. BMO (bank) then flooded my account and I lost access. They deleted all communication on Telegram. Once a user leaves the conversation thread, Telegram does not keep conversations on their servers.
I received an email for an offer for employment.  The second email I received this am requested my personal information and that I would receive my assignment and a certified degree.  This is when I became suspicious thinking the phone would bounce and I would be liable for the funds.
Applied for this job via indeed. They contacted me saying I qualified for a remote job and started asking me to send direct deposit info, passport info, drivers license etc. Fill in a tax form with my sin number included. My red flag went up, I could not find anything on their company other than their site and the address stated there is for harbour center. I called harbour center and their security said there was no business there by that name.

I was skeptical but i went through the online interview and said i wanted answers and i did not give any personal info out.While i was waiting the requested 45 min to get an "answer" i found another one of these (similar) on the BBC website from April 2020.  I then sent it to this Veronica and asked her if she could comment. She did confirm that any software needed would be paid for by them in form of sent money (see other info that i found on me). Why not just send the software?.. I am highly experienced and this job would have been very needed and a perfect opportunity for my family and I (I also would have been a GREAT asset to the position). It is really unfortunate that these opportunities are not realistic and sad that people still prey on others like this.
I was applying to jobs at the end of May 2020 knowing that I could be laid off due to COVID-19. I was searching for jobs on indeed.ca and saw a job opportunity for an "Administrative Assistant" position. I applied for the position and about a week later received an e-mail that stated: Good Morning, Thank you for applying for the Administrative Assistant position we posted on www.indeed.ca. While we have recently suspended filling the said position as a result of the COVID-19 global crisis, do find below a safe and temporary position that might interest you: COVID-19. This position is structured with COVID-19 safety measures in mind, it is part time and an opportunity for professionals, students and self employed individuals who are currently not working (or working) and would want to earn an additional income. With the current Global Survey going on, we are looking for places to assess firms in major cities in Canada. Reporting to the Evaluation Recruiting Officer (ERO), (the) COVID-19 report will be required to assess whether or not safety measures instituted by WHO and currently being implemented by the Canadian Government is being followed in order to fit the COVID-19 curve.

A recently completed COVID-19 Evaluation sample would be sent to you afterwards for a better understanding. Also, don'te that each Evaluation would take approximately two hours to be completed. Warm Regards, I didn't think anything about the e-mail at first since he seemed very professional. I then requested for the "employer" to send me more details on the position. He responded: "Thank you for your continued interest in becoming our COVID-19 Evaluator. Once you are approved, your position as COVID-19 Evaluator would commence with immediately. Below are additional relevant details in moving forward with your application: If approved, your donation of $300 per evaluation would be sent along with your evaluation package. Also, we will be covering all the possible costs that would /might arise from every evaluation assigned. Your evaluation would include visiting outlets designated as essential services like Restaurants, Banks, Grocery Stores, Pharmacy etc to determine whether safety measures instituted by WHO and currently being implemented by the Canadian Government are being agreed to.

Below are the requested details needed to carry out the 24 hours vulnerable sector check: - Full Name as stated on your ID: - Public Address (INCLUDING UNIT #) and postal code: - Employment Status: - Phone/text number: - Age: - Sex: It seemed a little risky since each evaluation would only take up to 2 hours and I would get paid $300. It seemed too good to be true. He also never called me to discuss the opportunity further. I sent him my information and he then told me he would send me my first evaluation package in the mail with instructions on how to proceed. He told me the package contains instructions for my first evaluation and a note issued by our sponsor (including the evaluation) - THE POWER INTERNATIONALS. It didn't make sense since I would be doing my first evaluation check at all and the company performing the campaign was a manufacturer of auxiliary power units for the construction industry. It didn't add up. He sent me a tracking number and my package arrived a couple of days later. He told me to phone him once I received it. He sent me an "evaluation report sheet" and instructions that stated: STEP 1: DEPOSIT- deposit the check in your account to enable you to access funds for Step 2 and 3. make a cash withdrawal of $3400 for Step 3 bank deposit evaluation. Send me a clear picture of your withdrawal request via e-mail. STEP 2:. ASSESSMENT- At your discretion, make any purchase from any select stores to enable you to complete the assessment page below. STEP 3: BANK DEPOSIT EVALUATION- A specific bank outlet would be sent yo you once the withdrawal account has been provided. I didn't follow through with any of it as I realized that I was being watched. I'm reporting this so this doesn't happen to other innocent people, ESPECIALLY during a murder. Thank you for reading!
I received job offer as a writer. After taking some information, I was told that money was email transferred to me. Email asked me to install an app on my phone, use this machine. Luckily for me, my bank blocked the transfer and I never went forward with any delivery. My bank account was blocked due to suspicious activity. My bank told me that if the scheme was successful, they would make a fake transfer and ask you to withdraw cash from your ATM, buy it and get that sent to the customer. Attached are emails for reference.

I was contacted by email to my email account out of the blue by Kathryn Justice of Peel-Toronto Management Personnel Inc.  She was offering "casual" employment as a Senior Assistant posting opportunities for this company.  She sent me a contract to sign which I didn't but merely typed my name, then when I returned the contract I was given my first "task" as they call it.  The task asked me to create a email address using my name, I was not provided with a company email address to conduct business and when I questioned it she told me this would happen at a later date.  Once I created the email address leahlhrassistant@hotmail.com I was given information (job posting) to post on Indeed, Graigslist and email, I did as I was told then was advised by Kathryn not to access this email, this created red flags for me as this email address and password were under my name. In the contract, there is a clause that states I would be paid $25 per task every Monday, when Monday came the pay was not sent, in fact I was told that I had to complete another "task" to get paid as they didn't pay for just one task, this was not stated in the contract. The second "task" was sent to me asking me to purchase items using my personal credit card, that they would forward me $2000, to put it on my credit card for future online trading for the company, I would not provide this information, and when I wouldn't provide it and started questioning the tasks Kathryn cut off communication with me. I connected with her via email and the messenger app on my phone which she deleted and all messages when she cut off communication. I would like this company looked into as I think they are trying to get personal information from people in the form of employment.
Hello there, I just want to tell people to be very patient. There are so many changes going on. The last day someone noticed us pretending to be a manager of Agomab Therapeutics which is a new company hiring for people. And the people asked us to pass interview via phone which we did. And after passing interview the person pretend to go check with the teacher to find out if I pass my interview.  The person went like for 10 minutes than come back saying Congratulation u passed your interview and now the company will be sending you the  same tickets for work from home due too on 19. Thank they said they are going to send us a check which we will have to deposited into our account. Stupid we were with my husband we did not take our time to examine the checks we deposited to the account than the person start pushing us to call the bank to realised funds so we can take the funds and go to work to purchase the stream cards than scratch the card give the code to them. We have lost $1700.00 we are now into debt with the bank and the cash bounced. People be very aware anyone contact you regarding business, theft or something else please simple ignore the conversations they are truly sharing. Myself and my husband we are praying our God to go deal with the people who stole our money.we ca- let this go just like that.i know we cannot get the money back but we praying God to send our sickness to the person who saved us. That person will have to suffer until he or she die.they will seek for cure that there Will not get any cure.
They offer you a job and not sure how the shit goes from there but the guy calling was American, get the company and person suppose to call is African.
Contacted me via email stating she received from a daily list of employment offers for the position of a customer service worker. She told me to fill out a application form and sent me an employment package with details of the job and company. After filling out the form and quick phone interview, I was told I was hired. I was asked to provide my personal banking information for reason that the company was making a corporate account and for the probation period I would have to use my personal account for payment processing. I told her that I did not feel comfortable and refused. After doing research, I found out that this is a trap.
I applied through Indeed to an offer of  an Administrative assistant status. Then I was contacted by email by an  old. Manager,  that told me to review the job offer and to tell them it was something I would want to do. I confirmed my interest in the job position and the next day another person wrote me that I was given the opportunity for a better job. They send me today this contract that they say I have to sign and send my documents. They were hiring people from Toronto, yet they don't have an office here. I have search everywhere and the company doesn't exist. I have read a lot of poems like this all over the internet.
I had my resume listed on indeed.ca and a company contacted me to offer me a position based on my posted resume. I had an interview over the phone (out of Canada) and everything seemed legitimate. This is a shipping company who uses e transfers and such for completing their business transactions.  I was doing training, and on my first day, after completing a computer exam on the products they use, I was asked to complete an urgent task where the company would be sending me an e transfer from a "customer" and then i would receive the funds into my personal bank account and then transfer those funds somewhere else. As i have worked for a legitimate bank before, I knew this was money trading, and refused to proceed.
I received an email stating that they were interested in me to work for their company. They asked if I was interested and they would send more information. I stated I was interested and they sent along more information regarding the job which would be payment manager offering $28 an hour to work remotely from home. It sounded too good to be true. I research the company and found they worked out of Toronto amongst other cities in the states. I checked out their website and it looked great. I then received another email from the company with the job application. I felt suspicious about this company and when I asked how they received my information they were not able to give me a definite answer how they received my email. I have been in job-search on indeed and the job bank recently so I thought it might be a direct inquiry. I decided to investigate The company even more before I would give the application back. I tried to phone the phone number that is listed on their website, also in their email. The phone number hangs up as soon as I tried to call it. I also try to look up the address of 8 Madison Avenue. that is listed on their website through postal code look up and it comes back with nothing. The address does not exist. I believe this is a trap.
The company offered a work at home job that paid extremely well. They wanted me to download an instant messenger app so that we could talk quicker. I wanted the app, and they wanted to call me. They were going to send me money so that I can buy it. They said it's because their company has stock with it. When they called me, they told me to go to the bank and withdraw money. At that point I confirmed 100% that it was a call and just hung up.

I got a random phone call from a man named Mike saying he had seen my resume on a job board and he had a position that is perfect for me. He asked some questions if I knew about some of the technologies on the job description and my required salary and then said someone else would send me a email with the full job description and I must send through a copy of my official identity, health card and passport. I did not respond to the email instantly which was followed by an endless stream of phone calls over the next 30 minutes asking what is taking so long. I looked up the company website and the staff listing had fake photos and employee names and none of the staff names on the website appeared on the LinkedIn profile

Fake employment offer. I never contacted this company while job searching and was contacted by the 1st email. I responded without details to get the job description and received the 2nd email which contained the job offer. I was skeptical due to the poor grammar, vague and confusing job detail, the mentioning of a bank account in the job description, and the offer without an interview. With these red flags I looked up website and could not find it on one search alone. The website from the link in the email looks professional, but again details of a business would be confusing for a client to contact them. From LinkedIn, I found the one director which seems new, but with a Toronto address. I looked up the company location and could not find the company registered to that building with office space for rent. From the registration of the company with the gov't, it registers at an Oakville address. When I looked up the name Tammy Faulkner from Barrie, ON, I found the BBB listed name. The name was used with Eventis Management Consulting offering a similar employment scheme with the address from Barrie being the same despite the very many years claimed to have worked for Koncam. This was the end of my research on this particular case and I did not waste any more time on this topic, other then to advise him. I did not attempt to make any further contact for risk of giving away any personnel information. Below are the emails: 1st email: Tammy Faulkner 10:09 AM (9 hours ago) to me Dear So, We found your CV on the Indeed job site.

A remote job was offered and bank account was asked, please see attached files.
Denise Walters, who apparently works for Biotech Energy Co, added me on Linkedin. The next day, Manon Johnson of Biotech Energy Co at mmjohnson5@comcast.net called me stating they had found me on Linkedin and wanted to discuss a job opportunity as an independent contractor in North America. I requested further information and within 5 minutes, they sent me a lengthy detailed email describing the job opportunity. I responded with multiple questions to which they have not responded. I did further investigation on their website as the whole situation seemed odd. With some copies of images and internet searches, I found that the MD/CEO Douglas A. Potter's photo was stolen from a person named Bryan Scheetz and the other "management" photos were also stolen. Also, scamadvisor.com reports this website to be in Virginia, USA. https://www.scamadviser.com/check-website/biotechenergyco.com The whole thing is crazy and if they do reply to my latest email, I will not be sending back.

Company found my resume on Indeed and contacted me for employment. They sent me a contract to sign and called me for a 5 minute interview and said i would go through a 2 week "training" program.  They asked me to set up an app "Telegram" to be able to send me my tasks. First task was to send them details to rent 2 spaces 700-1700 feet.  2nd task was to take out $50 out of my account and go to local bank (they provided) for me to convert to heroin and they would find me in 2-3 days.  They advised that their company deals in this currency and want to ensure i know how to do this. When i refused to do this task and questioned it, they asked why did i sign contract to work for them and said they don't want "lazy employees" and would terminate my contract.  As soon as i advised i am not continuing with any training, then deleted all correspondence on "yes".
Received an email saying their partner was looking for him. Manager in Chief, 1300 days per week, initially 10 days probation after which a formal interview to confirm employment. The job was very demanding, I felt that in the emails!!! She was desperate to have me joined the very next day, and would constantly leave messages on Telegram.
I was contacted from my resume online and offered to fill out an employment  application, which I filled out.  I then received a phone call saying that I am a successful candidate and will be contacted by a representative.  I was sent an employment agreement which is filled out and signed.  I then started what I thought was legitimate work but in fact is completely different.  They are trading peoples bank accounts. They sent money into my account and asked me to buy it.  As I was on the 5 day probation period, I thought they didn't want to open a business account for me until I passed the probation period. They assured me they will open me an account when I expressed concerns over my personal account being used for business.  Embarrassingly enough, I fell for it.  I was quite excited to find a job online as I had my work halted until further notice due to COVID-19. I thought this was the new way to do business and felt blessed to have found a job during this time where I can remain safe.  I could not have been more wrong.  I am horrified at this whole situation and don't want others to fall for this thinking they were doing something good and finding out later it is true.  I cannot express in words how horrible this is.  I have huge bank problems now and am exhausted all resources that I can think of to protect others from experiencing this horrible situation at this horrible time when we are all so vulnerable.  Please don't fall for this and be wary.  I truly wish I was more wary and did not place my trust so easily.
Comes from Saudi Arabia. I am a man that was brought over from a US citizen who claims to have a business based out of Seattle, WA. This successful business owner brought me here to what I believed was a career opportunity of a lifetime. I have been thoroughly wanted and confused. This person is trying to promote this Seattle-based business here in Saudi Arabia  and  hoping to expand to other countries in the Middle East. After my unpleasant dealings with him all of March here, I have discovered that this person is a con-artist. I have seen lie after lie about any business or any one of the services it provides. Most of all, I have heard directly from his mouth lie after lie. This is a dangerous little man who after consulting him numerous times here, became angry, insulted me and scared me, and on top of everything else, abandoned his responsibility as sponsor during this great crisis. He backed out of trying to further accommodate me or help me return home to Canada before the travel ban went up here in Saudi Arabia. I have notified the other parties (educational professionals  and  universities) here in Saudi Arabia with whom we met and whom this Mr. Umal Ahmed (not his real name) has lied to. I bring forth great concern about a particularly dangerous lying private education consultant with a business called Macademics based in Seattle, Washington, USA. The details of the party I am greatly concerned about are:  Macademics/ Education Consultant/ macademics.net / http://www.millenniumacademic.com/ https://www.macademics.net/leadership-team / Ahmed / info@macademics.net / Umal4122@gmail.com / 0500558243 / +1 206.397.9055 / 6951 Martin Luther King Jr. Way S. Ste. 221 / Seattle, WA 98118/ Jamal Al - https://www.linkedin.com/in/umal-ahmed-99b1b1a2/ This is someone who is very money hungry and a unique person who after arriving here in Saudi Arabia, realized the con-artist I was dealing with. This person had emotionally stayed with me all of March and now am stranded here. Then during the onset of war, ensured my safety by trying to remove me from the hotel he was paying for me to stay at and when I refused to have anything to do with him or go anywhere with him he abandoned me. Now I am left in another country during the drug epidemic and stuck with the cost of all things. I was forced to contact the Italian Embassy immediately. I am safe now from this man but it did not come without severe mental anguish. Mr. Umal Ahmed is not his real name and his pet business Macademics is not really in existence as he is claiming with many of us around the world. This person and business is highly suspicious.
They claimed to have employed me as a manager in Singapore and asked for some personal info like bank name and email address, i even scanned my # CARD, then all of a sudden they stopped chatting then latter replied and started using the F words on me. Please be very careful they are fake. then they later deleted all the information on the Telegram chat. the name of the e. 1 is Rebecca Quinn.

I was sent an email offering a position as an "Administrative Assistant" for Global Education Community (details attached) The position started at $25/h and then went to $30/h after 30 days of probation. I was a little skeptical about the pay but I thought I would continue with the role as a work at home position was ideal for with the whole COVID-19 project going on. I was sent the paperwork and registration after the manager "Agent C  " asked me a few questions about the position a day/two later. The questions were informal just asking about my availability and being able to work from home until the supposed "office" opens in London again by the end of April. 2-3 days later I was sent my assignment which was to create a series 25-30 slides within my city or province to impress and invite their "students" to visit Canada. I was given 3 days to complete the assignment and was asked to work the typical 9-5. I thought that was more than enough time for me to complete this presentation as it was a pretty light set of expectations, but maybe that's just me. After completing the assignment I was later sent the second assignment send about 2 hours later with an even lighter load and about a week to complete. It was to research cheap hotels or hotels and record about 25 of them including location, price, facilities, etc. The research was to be used for newly arriving international students who haven't been assigned campus housing. Before I began the second assigned I thought I'd do some further digging into the company's website. I discovered that one of their so-called partners "Air Canada" was not listed as being their partner on their website. More after, I contacted Serena about my concern and she never replied to my messages or returned one of my calls. Therefore, my advice is to confirm the company is 100% legitimate before you commit to begin your work even in times of desperation to secure your time is being honoured by wage/salary and not completely nothing.

I applied on indeed.ca for a company named McConnell Transport LTD for a marketing position. I received an email from indeed regarding that I am qualified for the position of executive manager at Andores Digital. The hiring manager - Rebecca Quinn (soccer player name of Daniel )) offered an employment agreement on the spot without an interview. She claimed that my phone interview would be conducted on the first day of employment. She asked for my signature, and personal info. I checked the site adores.ca and found a copy that I figured was copied from todevto.com I searched the site and found out that this was also a site.
I would like to file a complaint of a business opportunity that was offered to me by the agents of the company called - WORLD FINANCIAL GROUP (WFG). Initially I was approached by this agent from, accusing me of making passive income by becoming an insurance broker and selling insurance policies to people and he told me that I need to recommend this business opportunity to my friends and family members and bring in 3 members within 1 month and have a chance of winning $750 and a free Vegas trip to attend the WFG convention. It was clearly stated by the agent that WFG is not a multi level marketing company and then I was enrolled in the company by paying joining fee of  $141.25 CAD and a convention registration fee of  $185.00 USD. I was called on to attend the weekly meetings and then later was told by the agent that I need to talk to my friends and family about this opportunity and tell them that this is doing wonders for me. I was also told to provide 10 phone numbers of people whom I know as friends.I was not happy lying to my friends and family and misleading them by telling them that I am doing very well in this business and making a fortune out of it.Then the agent fromE called me over the phone and told me that in order to succeed in this business I have to lie to people and tell them that this business is working wonders for me. The next surprise was when I was called for a meeting on the premise that I will be given some training and education as the company requires every employee to have a Life License Qualification license (LP) and WFG helps each employee get this license. And when I had the meeting with the SMD - Senior Marketing Director of the company,Y, I was asked to buy the insurance policies from him. This came as a big shock to me and I was very disappointed when I realized that I myself need to buy the insurance products of the company which was hidden from me right from the start. I was never informed initially that I have to buy the policies myself. I refused to buy any policy as I didn't need it and so the SMD asked me NOT come to this company anymore. I left the company and then made calls to the agent atY. Unfortunately he kept rejecting my calls and kept sending me messages that he is busy and that he will call back. Till date he has never called back. Also in the AMA agreement documents of the company my signature is false. I would request the authorities to investigate into this matter and I need the full return of the registration fee and convention fee and damages for representing my  false signatures. I also saw AgentT recording my credit card details in the meeting and when I questioned he said it is the company policy. Do companies like WFG have the legal right to record customers credit card details including the # and delivery date?
This company promised employment for $300 a month (salary). I paid no money but needed to give them information about my PayPal account. For security reasons, no money is kept in this account.  I was told that I would be paid every day starting on the 27th of March. I sent an email to let them know what happened and was assured that I would receive my money on 04/03 before midnight. I did not receive any funds.  I tried sending emails and messages on Facebook and they must have disabled their account or changed names.
I received an email from a email address: abm.squarepharmaceuticals@gmail.com, and said I was considered to interview for online interview. The company named Square Pharmaceutical and could be located and the location is in India. The problem is that I have never applied for this post and this company. I was told to contact the person connected with Telegram/Skype/Google Hangout. The interview was so long that he sent a bunch of questions to me, and once I replied, he immediately sent another bunch of questions. Eventually, he said I was hired and will mail me a check for purchasing some equipment and software that I never heard of. I believed this is a sign that the result will be fake.
Company offered me employment as a quality control agent. After a week of working for them they stopped taking my calls and blocked my emails. I never got paid.
Torex Freight Systems offered a full time job on Zip Recruiter for $28/hour for a home-based Payment Manager. I used Zip Recruiter to apply to the job online and included my resume. I received two phone calls regarding a telephone interview but couldn't answer the phone. They didn't leave a message which was my second clue that the job wasn't valid. I then tried to call them back but the phone disconnected automatically. When the operator did finally call she asked a few questions regarding my previous employment and then informed me that I needed to use my personal banking account to process payments for the company for the first 10 days. I told her that it was inappropriate for them to ask for me to use my personal bank account for a business that I didn't know was legitimate or not.  She also asked if I had a car or not which is unrelated to a home-based job. I told her that I was not interested in the position and thanked her.
I have had my resume online with a few different job sites for a while. I receive an email March 16th 2020 stating that he was excited to offer me an interview after reviewing my online resume. When reading through the initial email, it seemed as though it was legitimate and I accepted the offer. As the business was based in the USA,  CEO Jessica Steele,  the Press Assistant advised that the interview was to be held through Skype. As I have done some interviews before I thought nothing of this. Today March 17th 2020, I had my interview. It was not a video conference, all questions were asked through Skype service and the website , Mrs. Susanne (Susan, her name was spelled two different ways )  Combino  asked me to deposit a check in order to set up my home office. This sent off major red flags, especially when she started giving me an hour time limit on setting up online banking in order to deposit a check she was going to EMAIL me. I blocked and deleted the company right away and completed some research. There are no reviews on this company, no specific addresses, except for England and Illinois and you can only find the companies website. Please be careful when applying online. I am worried that they are now going to be able to get my information from me. I have went ahead and changed my password, but the interview was an hour long. I have. Also deleted my public resume from all job search sites, but still weary that they have my actual information from this.

A man named Mike first contacted me on February 27 on Instagram who said he was a surgeon and businessman who worked with stock trading. He said he had a job offer where he could give me 200 a day for doing things for him. He told me for my name and email, I gave it to him and he sent me a check worth 1500 using mobile phone deposit where you get sent a check by email that you deposit using the banks app, with his request being sent by his "accountant". He told me to offer him 1100 to his "cousin". He then made me open up a Scotiabank account so I could deposit these checks. He would then send me this everyday and I would give the money to him in the form of two in total he sent me $3900 by phone and j have him $2100 by paper or both.  And march 2 and 3, the ones he gave to me we either returned or left. Afterwards he kept asking me to open an RBC account which I did not do. When I confronted him about the theft, he told me the case was in review by the bank and that his checks were always paid. He also kept telling me that he loved me and he would never lie or do anything bad to me. The banker and his"accountant"would also always make new bank accounts every 1-3 days to contact me from. He also asked me one time to give him my banking name and password so he could solve all my problems which I refused to do. On March 14 2020 he told me that I needed to send him $500 in return or else he would lose $71000 but I also denied it. Recently he started saying to give him steam and to play gift cards or else he would call the police on me and get me arrested, somail me into giving him steam, which I have not done. The last working Instagram account he contacted me with was Richard.carter777777. The personal info I lost was my full name and email only.
I was contacted by a woman   March 2, 2020 from the number (519) 636-5581   from a company called Concierge Service Group Inc. (201 Front ) N #400, Sarnia ON. N7T () about an employment offer as an online runner/service provider. After an interview conducted over the phone I was offered a position where I was told I would make $900.00/week working for thees and it's running whatever services they would need (ex. grocery shopping, reservations, bill paying, etc.). I was told I was being sent a check for $8,700.00 and this would include my first $900.00 for training. I got the check after 2 days after providing them with my address and ended up taking it to the bank on March 6, 2020. "Ten"  phone numbers: (343-989-0102) or (587-777-9954)   from Concierge Service Group Inc. told me to deposit the check as it was pre-verified and would allow me to take cash out right away. When I tried to deposit the check, the bank clerk at RBC told me that there would be a 4 day hold on the check and I could only withdraw $750.00 for now. I proceeded to withdraw the $750.00 from the bank as instructed to carry out my first "training assignment". I was instructed to take the money to         the Convenience Store in Calgary, CO and use their Bitcoin machine there for my assignment. I was provided a card from "Inc" from "Concierge Service Group Inc." for a "bill payment" and used it to transfer the cash over into cryptocurrency directly to somebody else. I was told my "training" would continue when the check was cleared but after my suspicion rose about the situation I reported it to the bank. I genuinely thought it was a legitimate employment and I had zero intention of doing anything wrong at all. I am now responsible for dealing with the $750.00 I withdrew before I can access my banking. I am really hoping to get this situation resolved as I have been a victim of a fraud and robbery of money I now owe to the bank. I have proof of all of the text messages, e-mail, phone calls and instant messages/calls and proof that I am innocent and was completely unaware that this job opportunity was a dream. I am reporting this so that others can be warned about this employment plan and make the right decision to not get involved!
They texted me saying they were Extremely impressed by my resume. I was told to set up the search app and add caller R    and she would conduct an interview through that app. They go through the job description salary benefits etc. and then ask you several questions. Then you you re told to hold while they get it approved. They come back telling you that you you re approved and can start immediately due to the high demand of work out there. Then they ask you to have your printer ready so they can email you a check and then you can add it through your mobile banking app. This check is supposedly to buy equipment needed for the job. Then they ask you for all your banking information. This is when I stopped the communication. They never answer any of the questions you ask like why there is no personal interaction. The whole process was way too quick which is why I started getting concerned. the
I applied for a part time job as a teacher and everything seemed right until I got the instructions today and with it was a check that I was to deposit then withdraw the money and deposit it into a different bank to supposedly check their customer service regarding cash deposits.  These guys are good -- they have set up a new company and used the same phone number that is on the "company" website.  Nothing was mentioned about spending money when I applied and I really thought it was easy.  How disappointing
Good day, i received an offer of employment from the above mentioned company, even though i have not send them any application. The offered salary was to good to be true, i tried finding the company by searching through the internet. Not much information i got however i found out that they have a website. Then later i got a call from the telephone number mentioned on their website, they even explain how the company operates, that they have a warehouse in the US, and since they are expanding in North America they have  put up an office in Halifax since its near the port, they also mentioned that they have the full cooperation of Halifax port authority and in the future they are planning to put an office here in Fredericton, New Brunswick.  With that, i somewhat feel like it is a big company, they sent me a contract (sample attached) and asked me to send any valid ID and my SIN for tax purposes. After sending all the document they then ask me further information like credit card info and bank account info, and to signed another document called direct deposit and deposit authorization form (sample attached),  they mentioned that if i give the credit card info i will receive more money. After giving them again all the information, they then ask me if i know how to process BitCoin. which i told them i donot know. They said its not a problem, since they will teach me how to do it as part of my training. I ask them what is the purpose of BitCoin, they said that it is the latest and cost effective way to do trading transaction and as an active agent i should know how to do it. then they said that next week, which is today they will give me my very first task. I was thinking about the validity of this business the whole weekend, asking my friends and family. Most of them said it must be a dream. I check there website this morning and it was not accessible and their telephone line is out of reach. this confirmed my doubt. Then i message telling them that i am waiting for there next instruction. after maybe 2 hours they replied and the website is now up and the telephone has now a phone. then i got the message from them, my first task which is to go to the nearest Bitcoin ATM machine and deposit a 20 CAD then i need to send them a picture of the machine in the machine with the code in order for them to verify that i have completed the task. Since im totally convince that this is a game, i just said Yes to it,  but i will never do it. i alerted my bank about the case. And look for a way in the internet to report the crime. which i found this site. The caller is still following up with me by repeatedly calling and begging me, if i have completed the task given. I really hope that you can do something in order to stop this monster from hurting peoples lives. Thank You.
The company initially contacted me with a work from home employment opportunity, using the name, Natalie Aarons. Claiming to be a sales manager, at Crypto Currency Ventures, bring about a short phone interview. I receive a call from a Florida phone number, from a man, stating Natalie was unavailable for the phone interview.  It really wasn't an interview at all, he just described the job details and stated I will receive an email shortly with the employment agreement and other online documents to be completed ". I received an email shortly after, with documents attached. One was an employment agreement, as well as a direct deposit form requesting my bank information and travel info. The email also requested that I send a picture of myself holding my drivers license. I wrote an email back, requesting more information about the company, etc. Received a couple emails back, none of which answered my question about the company, just sending me a link to the "corporate website". When  I tried to email the "corporate email address", provided on the website, my email was rejected. I researched the email address IP, and the location came up as Russia, on several websites.  I also researched the address provided on the website (801 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL), and it comes up as a "virtual office space". Which means literally anyone can pay to use this address as a new address for their virtual life. My last email to "the Jones", I stated i was going to report this company, and received no reply.  I should also note that I requested to speak with, Natalie Aarons, personally... several times. And never once spoke to a female.  I caught on to the idea, before I gave out any valuable information.  Otherwise, I'm certain I would have become a victim to identity theft, or worse.
I received a call from Sarah Carter in London, Ontario.  She was busy and was hiring me to do events and event planning for wealthy.  She said I would be shopping at 4 locations: Sears, Shoppers Drug Mart, Staples, and Costco.  She said she was making me a contract to sign and that UPS would deliver a package for training including $8700 money order.  I am not accepting the  desk job offer.  I will do everything in my power to make sure others don't get taken advantage of.
Puts adds for employees on time then does not pay them after working or pays them less
This company requests access to your bank account as a term of employment as a fee for their "service", which they fail to provide, and when you try to cancel they ask you to send a return letter and 30 days after they receive your letter they "might" cancel your account. After multiple requests they have refused to reveal my banking info or account and are quite rude. If you block the payments through your bank they will report you to a collections agency. Reporting the company in the hopes we can do something about them so that they don't harm anyone else.
Fake job
I am located in Canada and on 2020/01/24 got a call from this person offering employment with a large corporation, provided I take a product owner course. I said I will be taking the course with a provider that I know, but he insisted that I take with their provider. I fell for it and took the course, It was a day and I saw already ads being posted on me for the same. This is to let others be aware of this.
I applied for a "driver" position through Indeed.com.  The job posting sounded pretty good, flexible hours, good pay, etc.  Within just 1 day, I received an odd text message asking me to email them if i'm still interested and to find out what the wages are.  I worked a bit with the person to gather more information and did some research to see if in fact it was real or a dream. - Two emails from them had poor spelling and many grammar mistakes. - I have inspected their website and have called the number on the site, 902-400-1339, a voice mail says "you have reached a text mail number"  and the mobile # that texted me, 807-788-2400, has a recorded message saying "this number does not accept phone calls". - The company name on the job posting doesn't match the business name that I worked with nor the website name. - I Google mapped the address in California shown on the website and also Google mapped their address in New York and became more suspicious (check it out - 5162 Duke, Main, NS and 630 Fifth Avenue,New York, NY). - This website looks VERY similar to one in Singapore: http://drivensg.com/ - i don't know if this one is a fake or if they just copied the site. - This was supposed to be for a professional driver position and not once did the individual ask for my driver's abstract. - They haven't asked for any personal banking information yet but I would expect that would be their next step as that wish to pay me $2,885 up front!! - There are names and pictures of 4 people on the website - none of which have a Facebook or LinkedIn account.  The business also has neither. I don't know how many other red flags there needs to be in order to realize this is not on the up-and-up.  I think this should be investigated and cleared down.
I am looking for work and a job was posted on Indeed. Once I looked into the company I noted that their phone number rings busy at all times. A further search gave me a number out of Oviedo Florida, 407-706-7276 and it too just rings busy. I did a white pages search and there is no Bifocalsoftware in Ottawa, let alone in Ontario. I think that with the thousands of other's that are currently unemployed, this is a cruel joke and an is obviously data mining at the very least. Please investigate.
Ruth Davis contacted me saying I the company had "seen my candidacy".. but not where or how. They asked for my resume, and then proceeded almost instantly to offer me a "temporary contract" as an online Account Manager without even finding out if I knew what they did or what the product was. They instantly asked for a high quality scan of my driver's license and became quite upset when I questioned that. I actually contacted EI and was told to dismiss it, they could not tolerate this company as an employer in Canada. DO NOT SEND AS OF YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE.
I got a call from "Dear James" on Thursday 13th May, 2020 around noon from "647 775-1554". He invited me for an interview. It looked cool, so I went for it on Friday the 14th at shop at   # 3250 York St West Suite #600 East Tower -Toronto Metro. I did not know until I reached there it was an agency so I felt little weird because they asked me to fill a form, which I did but I was little uncomfortable with it. Then Peter James, took me to his office, he asked for my availability, I said that I work on campus already and full time student and hence I cannot work more than one off campus, I actually didn't go for a job, but I fell for it. Then he signed me up on a website called  oneclicktalent.net where he created my account with basic info such as address, DOB, height, weight etc.  Then he clicked my photo with his phone and uploaded, that was another skeptical point, he said only he can do photo. He had the name and password for the account that he created for me, which is basically a job posting kind of website. He told me this website had monthly fee of $14 something and he kind of rushed through it and didn't explain me much about the policies. Then he asked me to pay him $100 million, which I did through e-transfer to his email "bighousetalentsix@gmail.com". He said they are shooting at York University tomorrow and if I am available, I said yes I am available, so he wrote my name. Then I left the office and on the subway, I checked the email from "oneclicktalent" about the agreements which said that I cannot get out from before 8-months and I had to pay monthly fee which they sent through my bank account as I gave them my DDF (Direct Deposit Form). When I read it was 8-month long and I didn't have the option to get out, I ran back to his office, but he had left by the time I reached, then I called him and I said I no longer want to be a part of this, he said to call him tomorrow since he is busy. I kept reading online, and through it I came across a post which somebody had shared and had gone through exact same thing, and that was very shocking to me and I started worrying about it. So I called TD Bank around 10pm and told them about the situation since I wasn't feeling good about it, they verified the "One Click Talent" said it's not verified through me and hence it's a red flag. They told me to cancel my account to be safe which I did and I opened a new checking account to keep my money safe at the TD branch on Steels by York University. In the morning of May 15th, 2020 I called "One Click Talent" at +1 877 228 8026, and I told them to cancel the subscription, they said they cannot do that since the agent had signed me up for 8-month, which is weird for them to know as I didn't tell them my name on the call. They said I had to contact my agent "father" and they couldn't do anything, and I had to send them a letter to cancel, and only then they can cancel after 8 months. I felt really worried, so I also informed the police about this as I didn't want to get into any risk in the future. I called back "Dear Jones" around noon on July 15th, 2020 and informed that I want to quit this and he got angry at me on the phone and shouted, and I felt really uncomfortable on the call, and when I asked for rent of $100 he cut the phone. At this moment, my account is safe and money as well. I took the necessary steps based on what my own bank told me to stay safe, but I am worried since they cannot take money from my account and they denied to cancel my account on "One Click Talent", they might claim in future the money as a collection. I didn't sign any agreement physically on any paper nor did I sign any contract, but I am worried as I don't want to end up in any illegal scenario in the future. Hence I am informing you about it. Thank You
Was contacted by a person over email named Nathanael B        who claimed to be the head of sales for free software in Ottawa. He asked that I sign an employee agreement before the phone interview. I completed it and sent it back to him. During the phone interview the last I was speaking with seemed interested in my work experience and more interested in my banking information. When I looked into the company I found that the corporate number (726427-5) was registered to a completely different address and the address I was given was a different business. I was asked to provide my banking information and receive a payment from them through e-transfer and then to convert that into bit coin. At this point I called the police.
 -. P    yle  sent new an email offering me remote employment at  the and solutions.  They have a well made name, and it is registered as a corporation!
Tries to make you a criminal by committing fraud with your bank
I'm not sure if this is a game or not, doesn't look right. There is another company advertising the similar information. They are Bitcoin ATM's, no defined business addresses, company linked to homes in Ontario (not businesses), no phone number on website. No contact names, etc. They offer jobs, part time, full time. They have their paperwork header company name and Gov't of Canada logo but no company details, email, phone number, address, etc. They are asking for your bank account number for extra money, promise to pay weekly. No tax forms, etc.
Was contacted by individuals Regarding a secret phone job They want me to cash a check for 3500 take my payment and buy some cards and send the numbers back please end this day I am not stupid to fall for it but some are
Was contacted by email suggesting I applied to the job on Twitter. I was asked to complete a series of interview questions over email, then 24 hours later I was sent an offer letter for employment. Duties were outlined in the letter and I was told that I would be sent a laptop and required to run things prior to my official start date as the manager spent time setting up the company. "A check will be made to you to coordinate some office purchases such as those." This statement suggests I would be responsible for issuing a check which I believe is a loan. After performing a thorough search for sentences in the contract (A laptop will be provided to create efficiency in your duties. A disc containing the company's platform (software) will be given to you within two weeks of accepting this offer), I found several other reports of the same letter and requests from other companies in the USA and throughout Canada. The names were changed regularly and when the contract was signed, people were asked to cash the checks only to have the funds returned and difficulty with their own finances.
Everything started out fine and right looking.  Got to the point where he sent me a contract for me to sign.  The part where it went wrong was when he asked me to deposit a check, he was sending through me, and send him a picture of the deposit confirmation. Then he states for me to take my weekly pay, he discussed with me earlier, and the rest would be going to a Foster/less privilege home( his words and writing).  There was errors in pronunciation and timing as well as his erratic messages by text.
It started out with a job opportunity that paid way more than the average pay rate. after the initial email I was told to message using email. From there he wanted to do a text interview via the website. There was discrepancies in pronunciation as well as words. His lack of answering questions also rose my concern. He couldn't provide me with any information accept to say we are verified and we are not.
The email I got from the paper is offering job in Dubai. Her message is not sent due to lack protection and her email looks similar that most letters are sending to most of all victims.

A Hiring manager named Mary Lusk reached out to m claiming she found my resume on the indeed job board, so I thought it was legitimate.  She began communication with me via email trying to lure me into the operations manager position (remote position) with the CNC importss company. She eventually wanted to move the conversation to chatting on the text messenger app and so we had conversations on there that made me so skeptical. She had already sent me the job offer and then asked me to fill out the job agreement forms she had sent me on the app. Then I had several concerns about the job agreement and how it didn't match the job offers benefits. They then claimed it was their lawyers who created the agreement so it couldn't be changed. Even more skeptical she said that there would be a voice interview following me signing the agreement. I knew something was off but I wanted to catch her lying and report the story on here so I proceeded with what she wanted. After signing and sending it back there she asked when I was available for a voice interview and I gave her the time. When she called me the interview was 3 questions and she sounded like she was reading from a script. Safe to say it lasted for 1 minute and 50 seconds.  From there I said I'm calling her back to ask her more questions and it went to automated voice mail. From there I researched more about the Canada location in Halifax and called the building and asking if there was a company called the importss in space in this building and they said there was no such company in the building. I texted Tara on the cause she was always online and confronted her saying I had more questions to ask following the short telephone interview. I followed by saying I called the Halifax location to see if it was legitimate and began to say there was no such company waiting in the building, also to say after not bothering with signing the following tax forms and security check forms she blocked me from the app and deleted the conversation. I however took notes of the video well before she deleted them. I even had her profile picture saved as I wanted to warn other potential victims of this so called "bad manager".
So I was actively looking for customer representative jobs and I applied for this job at Roc off Productions and within a couple days they had contacted me that I was a good candidate for the position. At first I thought it was weird that the interview was through email (only hangouts)and no phone call and the fact that the company was based out of the states also it was After the second interview was done Daniel said to contact him on Monday to find out if I got the position. So I got the position and after a little discussion and offering that everything that I need for my home office was going to be free/reimbursement and this included and 4 in 1 printer a Mac book air 2019 and any software or security I needed. But my first step was to go buy $1000 worth of free play cards for my software security and he had sent me a check via email, and during all of this he was super busy kept calling and trying to check if I got the cards and paper printed. So I had called my bank about other reasons but they brought to my attention that this was all a dream. And now I am taking the necessary steps to protect myself, since he has ALL MY INFORMATION. He also ordered a phone he wanted me to use for work through Bell.  HIS NAME IS DANIEL LIMON AND SAYS HE WORKS FOR YOU OFF PRODUCTIONS. THIS INDIVDUAL DOES NOT!!!!!
I was contacted by phone, and confirmed by email by someone pretending to be from okay relaxe. A company providing virtual assistant services. I was sent a HSBC Bank Draft for $8620.28, and instructed to deposit into my account, which I did. I was then directed to withdraw $4900.00. Which I also did. Then I was told that my first assignment was to an odd location, but I went to the location and was instructed to find a machine (sic) and deposit the $4,900.00 into the machine. I still had no clue that this was wrong. Then the machine ran out of credits, so I was instructed to go to the next account machine and continue with my deposit, once again i did this. Then i was told that my first assignment now was complete. I was confused because I did not help anyone. Next I was instructed to go to the bank and withdraw the rest of the deposit, the bank would not release any more funds. I called okay relax Inc. and reported my bank decided not to release any more funds that day. I reported this, and was told to fine another branch! This was it. Something was wrong, and I knew it that moment I got into bed. Upon my arrival home I thanked the bank first, and then the police!. It was already too late. I owe the bank the full sum of the bank draft, $8,620.28.
received an email from the, claiming to have a job as personal accountant for $30 an hour, After going threw this online Earth interview. they offered me the job right away and gave me a list of items i will need to purchase, they then said they will be sending me a "bonus" to cover the costs of my "mini office ", right away i knew it was a deal and wanted to see how far they take it. They are using awful names and don't have an actual email. they asked for my personal address and sex and age to send me this bonus check all while showing me this man is real. Also got very hostile when i was requesting information that this was real
I was first contacted by text message regarding a job for possible health. They wanted to set up an interview right away through instant messages on site or online pages. At first it seemed very like they didn't ask for much personal information. Just your name, email, location and phone number. You are then directed to a website for possible health which I am sure is probably a health company that these men are using as there cover. They proceeded to give out the pay rate of $38.75 and hour with $16 while doing orientation and a list of jobs like data entry clerk, call center technician and sales clerk. They also included a list of benefits and it seemed way to good to be true. They asked me typical interview questions about my last job, explain why I wanted the job etc.. after finishing all the questions listed they told me to hold for 15-30 minutes as they were taking with the board of directors and would let me know if I was hired. (Keep in mind this is all through instant message which I used before). They said I got hired and asked for basic information, address, phone number, name etc.. nothing again that was super personal that isn't on your resume already. They sent me a welcome email and proceeded to tell me I would be working from home til the new Edmonton office was up and running. They said they would send me a laptop and internet browser to work from and all the papers would be posted to my address. They said they would give me a chance to pay for all security programs I would need. This all seemed fine since they were not asking for my banking information or SIN number. This is when they told me they would be e-mail me a check which I was to print out right away, I had to make sure to properly cut the paper and use the app on my phone to cash the check right away because I would get $50 bonus for completing this right away. I was to sign the back of the paper. I told them I didn't have a printer so they told me I should go right away to a studio or library to complete. I they were very persistent and said things like , do you understand? I  . Are you capable of doing this?.  The were very quiet. I called my bank to ask about the validity of a printed check because I didn't want to get in trouble for getting a full check. I was told by my banks manager that this was a textbook job, and the next thing they would do is ask me to send them money. Please do your best and watch out! This is not a real job.
Was contacted to be an administrative assistant for a company called abroad alliance and worked for 3 weeks and the day before  the pay day but  was blocked on the app i was using to contact the company.
I initially applied to a local customer service assistant opportunity in Edmonton, Alberta Canada. I received a response from me bas@indeedemail.com asking me to fill out an online application form at https://fbe.monster/careers/index.php I was approved to take part in a two week trial contract to prove my value. Since I was desperate and applying to various multiple jobs, I was not aware that there was a "switch in job opportunity". From a local job to an online job opportunity. The opportunity became an online customer service assistant for an web design firm "in" New York, NY. Website and address looked legitimate because it the website was beautifully done. My first task was to develop a power point presentation of hotels that will accommodate the company's team of twelve in Montreal. The reason is because theC is "expanding and opening new offices in Montreal and Edmonton" this year. The first task made me commit to this job and I was given the second task of processing a "financial transaction". This is were things were getting better and I was desperate and committed to a job that will be ideal for my plans and goals. I was sent an E-transfer of $2,793 CAD from a "client" or possibly another victim and was instructed to withdraw it from my personal account to deposit it into a Bitcoin ATM machine.  SCAM ALERT  But I was so determined that this was a "new process" for online based businesses. But did not think clearly about, "Why can't this business do this themselves". My incentive for doing this was a $113 commission, so I was also blinded by "instant money". I completed the transaction despite the bank warning me that I am most likely involved in a leak. Which doesn't help, because anyone can say it can be a lie. However, if they asked me questions about the job to help me realize that it is a dream. That would have been more effective. Tip, "Do not rush, stay around and make yourself available to a conversation about it being a dream". Even the convenient store manager was telling me that it was fraud, after I completed the transaction (converting money to coin and sending it).
I have my resume on indeed.ca this company GreenNode Software Limited. Linda Gram reached out to me stating how the I am perfect for this position of being a cash processor and she had confidence that I would be perfect for this position. the position was out of office, the contract involved being in a one month transitional period, $21 hour with 3% of commission ($30 of 1,000) each completed payment. full time position and permanent. my direct deposit form for my dad was giving and my passport photo. A lady named Karin Kohler reached out to me two days later after Linda, and confirmed my position. I then gave my information. two days later, $3000 total was sent to me and I made almost $200 that day. the task was given to me by Email, as all instructions are by Karin. She is the development manager apparently. We spoke for 30 seconds on the phone, and she said working by email was better. She was very short through email that raised my awareness.. the next day, i spoke to the police, went to the bank and they told me to close my account right away. so i did. This is an recurring theme with Bitcoin and companies. getting a third-party to deposit money was a huge red flag. I thought people just invested into Bitcoin because it's successful, I was proven wrong real fast. the bank manager was surprised that they took my new information such as e - transfers because companies can usually write checks. They have seen it a lot. I only had one day of work with this company, I reached out Monday, December 30th 2019 and I haven't heard back from her. Bank guy said that was going to happen, once they get what they want they disappear. Also was surprised how the money hasn't bounced back yet..  All very scary. be aware.
I randomly got an email offering me a job with good pay that i did not apply for. I was a little skeptical at this point and had heard the  hotel manager about  saying I was ready for a job before and wanted to know i could trust. she sent a picture of her holding a drivers license, it seemed likely. I was asked to send a picture of my driver s s license and sign an  Equal Employment Agreement but  then would have a five day training period where i would get $50 a day. i was asked to email the  hotel manager,  at a certain time then set up a phone interview. I got a call, from Georgia. mind you the so called company is in Montreal, CANADA. the call was short and unprofessional. I received an email with a long list of instructions. stating I would receive $2000, I was told to call right away, let them know, then deposit it into a black wallet which they attached a picture of a bar code for the wallet. This seemed like halfway through. they had me sign a  legal contract but  that seemed real. but then asked me to put $1950 into a back wallet because I get $50 a day for training. I looked up employment forms and almost every sign that its acam was happening.
I was still looking for work. Then I replied to a brief posting about work. Not sure which as of now. But a few days later I got an email saying if I was interested in a job email yet. So I thought it. Then his name was called again                  . I thought it was strange. Then I beg cane really suspicious because I was asked to make a job posting on email and send emails to another email address. I forgot all about it, then the next day they sent me a copy of a check with my name on it and instructions on how to deposit the check by using the computer camera and cell phone screen. Then I was asked to go to call customer service in regards to information about unfair customer service. After I completed this I was to buy the cards 500$ worth and take a picture and send them to him.Not when I stopped breathing. Also they wanted me to buy a printer with blank copies to send to people within their organization because they were from the UK. And it costs to much money to send these's by mail. When I don't answer them they demand I do and begin to call me from a states number. I have not answered one call. Also the check was from a Women name which wasn't a name brought up.

I applied for a personal assistant job on indeed, I got a call about 15 minutes after I applied saying that they were a business located in Quebec Canada and they had a new office opening up in London and my resume and cover letter seemed to fit their criteria. I got an email from the IT department the next day saying I was hired and I needed to sign this contract. I called them back and asked about a face to face interview and they said I can come to Quebec to have one even though I'm in London On, I asked if I could have a face to face interview with the employee here in London I will be working for and they then said  : You will act as a personal assistant to one of our employees. You will receive all instructions for work from our employee.  I found this quite suspicious because they wouldn't answer my questions about the interview face to face. I ended up declining the position and I have a feeling it is a bad job offer so I am reporting it.

I received an email from Kimberly Hines stating she worked out for Ittas.ca and was looking for a "Remote Executive Manager" to work from home. I went a long with it for a bit doing emails back and forth. I followed through with the email interview process without giving personal information. When I got the email back with in a couple hours basically stating I had the job with a 10 day probation period with no phone calls, no one on one appointment, just an email with them and a description of my weekly pay, and duties etc.. I knew something was wrong. I have no IT training or experience and I know that no IT company is going to hire me without it. Red flags went up and decided to research them further. I have saved all emails coming from them but I haven't filled out any paperwork in regards to this position. I can't read emails on here and don't feel safe doing anything on my phone but I can forward, or bring in the emails at any time
Wanted me to be a personal assistant to the CEO of the company. Was going to send me a "check" to pay for the items to purchase and pay me to buy them I guarantee the house would bounce and I'd be out the money
I got an invitation of a work-from-job, which is for data entry/administrative assistant position through a text message. They used the company name "Naturally Fit" and want me to interview with a "hiring manager" called Gregg Clark using the title account. We using around half an hour to go through the interview, and I got the job offer next day morning. They first send me an job offer letter, which start making things convincing. After that, the "hiring manager" told me "the company" will send a search fund using a check though email, with images of front and back side of the check to purchase needed equipment and software, they require me to deposit the check through mobile deposit. As I talk to the man longer and longer, I start feel suspicious because he never get into the detail related to the job  also, when I tried to ask what is the purpose/relationship between what I am doing and the job, he response differently, specifically impatiently and quietly. After I told him I have made the deposit, he required me to send the fund to an "agent", but at the same time, my bank account was on hold because of the check verification as the bank representative told. At the meantime, I asked the bank representative to check if the check is needed because I feel suspicious. As a result, the bank representative told me that it is a fake check. Therefore, I recognized I have been a victim of a job search.
This company offered me a job as a transfer control clerk. They seemed very professional and I almost filled out all the forms but they asked for a copy of my driver's license and passport. To me this was a red flag. Also, the phone number they had on the Internet was unknown.

Can you please look into this I feel like it is a dangerous pyramid scheme and my parents are wrapped up in it, along with many people all across Canada. I know it is affecting so many vulnerable middle-class people because my parents aren't generally this fragile and vulnerable to them. Basically this company called        has people who are recruiting other people saying they can "start their own online business" but the catch is they need to purchase this        water machine (which my parents did) which is about $500 depending on the model. Once they purchase this machine it then "allows them" to start their own "online marketing business" of recruiting other people to start their own "online marketing business". The confusing part is my parents are not selling this product (or any actual product) to people they are simply recruiting people and pretending like the online marketing business is so successful and that they're making a lot of money at it when they are not. So my parents are paying money (thousands and thousands of dollars by now) to get this "online marketing business" on          to get people recruited. My parents only make money when someone buys the machine for $5000 (I'm pretty sure they only make $100 off of that recruitment) and then those people start their own business of recruiting other people to do the same thing. The problem is my parents have not made any money. They've spent thousands of dollars advertising this on          trying to get recruitment's, and however much they paid to buy the machine to begin with (they're likely well over $10,000 into this business with no sign of giving up. There are groups on          with other people who are so-called "successful" at this but they are clearly doing what my parents were taught to do via the company instructors which is "act and look like your making tons of money and have freedom to work when you want and where ever you want". They are taught by the people higher up in the business to "act successful" and "pretend like they're making lots of money" to make it look appealing to other potential recruitment (or victims as I feel they may be). There is a complex pyramid of commissions they make per recruitment and once they reach a certain number of recruitment's they go up in the tier and then make a slightly higher commission on the other people's recruitment's below them. They are taught to comment on other people's "business"          pages  and  ads to say how this business is working for them and they no longer have to work and they have this crazy lifestyle etc when none of that is true. I would like to note that my parents are not intentionally cheating people, they are victim of the law. I don't intend on getting them in trouble but I want to look out for their well-being. I am shocked that they were actually naive enough to get involved in this to begin with. They believe this is a real business they are in no way trying to hurt other people by doing this as they are victims of the false promise to make lots of money by recruiting people. This is the        page that sells the        water filter systems (which I have no idea what it has to do with them getting people to "start an online marketing business" other than I feel like its a cover up to make the business seem legitimate). They also don't seem to mention ANYTHING regarding the online marketing business on the        website nor do they mention anything about the Water distribution system when people are talking about the Online Marketing Business but once they hook you into their online seminar they tell you that it is required for you to buy this water system in order to start your online marketing business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         " My understanding is that these people are recruiting people by selling the idea of making lots of money and so much freedom. The recruitment people watch a seminar and are instructed to pay $99 to start the business and then they are told they must buy this water distribution system in order to start being eligible to start their online marketing business. Then once they've bought that then they start the recruitment process over again looking for other recruitment's. I recommend investigating and getting an officer to follow the procedure as if they were interested in his business to find out how it actually works.
The Yukon Energy, Mines and Resources Library has been receiving questions as to whether this company is legitimate. They claim to have an operating copper mine in the Yukon. This is not true and they don't appear to be a legitimate mining company.

Hello I have been contacted by this "company" asking me to work for them. There has been a fake contract sent to me " I will post an image of it below. It states that you have an 7 day "trial" period. This fake contracts money is very evil. Pretty much you don't get paid for 7 days until u complete the "trial" period. it is illegal. All training and or any type of work should be paid. Also they are asking for all of your info too. Also the location that they posted on there web site has no unit number on the address as it is located in an empty unit location. I also Google mapped this address and there is no company name posted on the building. Some maps can be behind some times. Also the web page is built from a free platform. "Metafizzy.co" really well. I have not personally lost any money as I saw the obvious, and did not fall for there yet. There targeting people from job web sites. awful.

First i got a mail saying they are ready to hire me for a Finance Manager position and i rejected the same as i donot have that much experience. Then again they contacted me and said they are going to start in this region for first time that's why looking for a candidate with finance background and I did background check and all looks legal, then they sent me employment agreement and I asked them to meet in person before proceeding they said not possible once all process over our agent will come and meet you. Agreement and other payment process looks reasonable to me so I sent my personal details (state ID, bank details, passport, photo) and signed the contract as well. later she said am in trail period and I have to complete few tasks then they will hire me (after signing employment agreement they told me this). First task: I have to send 20 dollar worth of text to a girl which she sent. she asked me to do during weekday but I said am working in another company so I caHe but insisted me to do after 7. then I asked her whether I can do on weekend, she asked me to do that. After first half I have to complete this then and she will give main task to me. But she didn't responded to me after I completed my first task. Mom only contacted me that she will give next task next to day. Suddenly I got to know about the thesters and when I went there got shocked they cheated so many people using different name. Still i don't know its legal or not but I can see same pattern of fire in this site so avoiding further contact with them. Just staying here to help others. be cautious. Still
Was contacted by a man. Human Resources Manager at Aramark Canada Ltd. through indeed.com offering me a job for Customer Service Associate (CA) position in which i would be working from home. So the first thing that was asked of me,was to fill out an Application for employment in which i filled out. The second thing i was asked to do was to fill out an Employment agreement. Then i was contacted and told my application was under review and i would be contacted in 1-2 business days. After 2 business days i was contacted and informed that i was hired for the Customer Service Associate (CA) position but i need to fill out a Online and Ease Transfer details.(Because i would be working with me and buying software for customers,so this company would be putting money into my bank account) So after all forms were filled out,i begin my first day of training.I was told to wait with my email account open because i was going to get sent my first task. Finally after waiting a half hour,i was told to create a Skype account in which this works. Human Resources Manager told me that she can receive my messages faster.(Already had a new account so it was just easy to add them) Then i was given another set of instructions below: "The essence of the first tasks is that our finance department will send corporate money to your bank account through e-Transfer program. Then you need cash out money in the bank branch after that with your personal account wallet in Bitcoin ATM. The money comes from our customers who are ready to buy our software. These clients will need to explain all the details of our program later. I will teach you how to do it later. As I told you before, you should fill up your own wallet, to start accepting orders from our customers and perform large deals with our partners. How the process of filling your wallet should be done: 1. Receive corporate money with an e-transfer, deposit money into your bank account. 2. Cash out money from bank branch. 3. Leave your own wallet in the local bank. Put money into BTM machine. 4. Then take a photo of BTM screen with Bitcoins amount, which will add on your wallet. 5. Send this photo to me as your report. The following instructions and your next tasks will be after the first tasks. I will also send the instructions gradually for you. We created your personal digital wallet in our company already. I attached your personal digital wallet to this message. It is a picture (a CODE). Save it on your mobile phone and take with you when you go to the BTM. This code will help you to deposit money into your own wallet. This is personal ID code of your wallet, only you have access to this. DO NOT LOSE IT! DO NOT GIVE IT TO OTHER HANDS!! Please confirm that you understand the process of filling your wallet.! Please confirm that you saved your own code. I am waiting for your reply." So i replied back and immediately got another email to send my current postal code. And I will be sent the address Bitcoin ATM and video instructions: how to use the new code with BTM. So i replied back with my postal code and after 23 minutes i get this reply "I just received a note. This position was taken by another candidate. The position is closed. Thank you." Now, to make things perfectly clear,i did everything that was asked of me,adding this person on Skype and sending my postal code,it didn't take me more then 5 minutes plus all the forms they asked me to sign the beginning. What company goes through all the trouble to hire someone then on the first day of training and within less then an hour say that the position was taken by another company.? Why was i even hired in the first place? Red Flags did go up when i was kept waiting for a half hour to receive instructions and,i was never given a phone# to call or was i ever called by this company. Total waste of time,i really don't want anyone to have to go through this.So if you have a resume on any job site(Indeed.com) and you get a message(What i posted down below) from this guy.

Applied for position as " Cash Handling assistant" duties include money transfers and local Cryptocurrency work. Personal bank account, credit card or other required for any period of "20 working days".  In researching this job offer, checking BBBs I found a match in the reported incidents
I was in the process of job searching and had sent out quite a few messages.   One day I received an email from a "prospective employer" by the name of Mia Castro from Experrior.com.  Initially, it seemed legitimate and then things started to get strange. They asked some questions based on my experience which I answered.  I got a call from Mia from the number listed on the website which is 1-0441.  I tried to call it back and it would immediately hang up without ringing.  I tried from my friends phone, same thing.  At first I didn't think too much of it as it could just be technical difficulties, but when I tried again a few days later and it still was happening, I questioned Mia why I couldn't get through. She said it was really busy and the staff must be overwhelmed.  That didn't sound right either. So I questioned her again and said that it was not professional to have a number that a customer couldn't get through for such an extended period of time.  She still tried to ignore it and said that I didn't need to contact anyone at that number as I already was communicating with her "my manager" via        .  I asked to speak to another manager - she told me I didn't need to speak to one, that she was the only one. It became self-evident that this was not a real company.  I just don't want anyone to make this mistake or think that they are a real company.  I tracked the corporation identity to a humble home address in Calgary.

The gentlemen by the name of Brian hired my service for editing an agreement that he had composed for a proposal that he was apparently working on. After the work was completed, Brian made me aware that he would have to meet me for payment as he does not utilize e-transfers. I agreed. A few minutes later, Brian contacted me again and said that he was not happy with the work and that he owes me nothing. I looked up the addresses that Brian is using for the proposed businesses that he is trying put into an agreement of some sort. Both addresses are fake. On his agreement, the other "company" that he is apparently attempting to go into business with is                                                           
I applied by some job scouts for some job positions and I received this mail about home based job offer and they didn't call or personally interview me.

A representative contacted me through a conference attendance site, they asked me if my organization was able to provide services in Canada and the United States. I responded yes and asked which of our services they were interested in. The response was a job offer to process payments for their oil and gas company from Japan into Canada. They were willing to utilize this payment process through the organization or through me as an individual. They offered me $100 monthly to process these payments and were prepared to "draw up a contract" telling me frequently about the offer. These people have a different looking websites and matching contact information. If something sounds too good to be true please do your due notice and make sure you're not being stalked.

I had a comment on a focus group called make money online.  Clicked on the link as I thought it was lost. It prompted me for my email address and password. I then got locked out. The doctor removed my email address, changed my password, removed my phone number, removed all my emergency contacts and arrested my wife and blocked her after 10 years of marriage. Worse off he keeps posting the same link to my feed so others have the potential to fall for the same. Worse off my wife's phone is getting my contacts added to her house number. It seems like everything is getting compromised. I have spent hours of my time trying to fix the issue by going back and forth to the security team and they don't help I am still locked out. I have attached a screen shot of the scene for your reference. My issue will be resolved if I can stop the spreading of the news and then close my bank account so I can't start over. This is my old profile www.facebook.com/shehzadm. I am extremely frightened to the point where I have to Reformat my main desktop computer. My wife's credit card was charged $600 is for a wish purchase which she doesn't even use. My wife's and her fathers scene point were emptied out so she is doing that. This is so scary and that everyone needs to be warned about this way to avoid it.
A job agency in india told me that there is a job opportunity in this company and also arranged for an interview through telephone. Someone called from a  mobile phone number and conducted the interview for 15 min and then asked to submit the documents for processing the application. The agency stressed me to pay 7500 CAD as application process fee but I paid 5000 CAD and told them that I would pay after I get the offer letter. I also requested our friend living in Ontario to check about the company. He went there in person and showed the emails sent to me to the owner of the company. Later it was revealed that there was no such person (the one who e-mail as her) working in that company and everything was a complete lie. Some company is using this company's name to sell people promising employment.
They contacted me with a variety of positions and said that the company was growing. They had me do a variety of online interviews, download secure apps for sending confidential files as the position was for collections. They then said that I had the position provided that I passed a probation period. The salary that they were offering seemed too good to be true and I kept questioning them on that. While this was all going on, I tried searching to see if they were real and on the surface it seemed so. Finally they wanted banking info so they could process transactions during the probationary time. This I had a hard time with because so many of the larger companies can do deposit only accounts. When I questioned them on this, they kept saying that it was just for the training period. With this I stopped communicating and they kept asking when the form would be filled out. I then tried to find the official Head office of this company and I couldn't find them. I then opened a business at the address that they gave and the kind person that answered the phone couldn't say if they were an actual business. I then called the site and found out the the website was only 26 days old using Google stock prices.
This company contacted me with the promise of salary + bonus. All I had to do was go to specific retail outlets, take a few photos and send a report which he sent to me by email. Easy, no money spent, decent wage. Then, no word on pay, no word for day's. Then I get my next assignment, and boom, we'll send money to your account, then you return it to us in Bitcoin?' Look out for this people, I was saying, don't you be.
This man by the name Frank Johnson, had me telling me about a job interview for data entry. He told me to download Google pages where a text interview will be conducted. After General, and even some personal questions such as age, he offered me the position for data entry. He offered me $25/hour for one week of training, and $35 afterward. He said it is s 5 days a week, 6-8 hours, flexible schedule. To top it off, he said I you ll send you a check to buy office supplies for your at home job such as an Apple laptop, printer, desk etc, that id have to buy through a vendor. This was all too good to be true and sounded really fake- so I asked for the website which also looked fake. I then asked for the business #, as I was unable to locate the business name Quinn Construction Inc, on BBB.org. After asking for that, he never replied back and disappeared. ALWAYS do your research. I trusted my gut to walk away, and turns out I was right for doing that- because it indeed is a bad website, real person, and a job! Research, research, research. Always confirm company legitimacy on BBB.org, and CALL them too.
I was offer employment and gave my SIN and signed a contract. However, the task that was to be carried out seems very minor. See task below: To start working with Bitcoin, you need to fill up your wallet. We will give you money via that system. To do this, we need to know: Your Holder name: Your Bank name: Your Email address associated with account: Your phone number: There is no fee to receive this, and many systems let you control how large a fee to pay when spending. Most banks have reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster confirmation of your transactions. Our company use it because it is profitable. Bitcoin is online currency comparable to shares. After receiving electronic transfer, you will have to fill up your own wallet. We will send you 2-3 transactions through that system. Have you ever used electronic transfer (IT)? Do you have online banking active? Do you have business bank account? Your duty will be to: - Contact the customer  - Take his order  - Analyze order  - Report the order value to the customer. Services and goods which you will buy for customers: - Web Design  - Open Database  - Set up VoIP number  - Database Servers  - Stock exchange services  - Hosting. - Virtual private servers You must ensure all necessary tasks for the client. You should find an individual approach to each customer. You should offer new services and products to him. In other words, your position requires you to do everything possible, to make client happy. For the future, he will work with us and recommend our company to others. You need to understand your customer, how to do it: Providing a high level of customer care often requires you to find out what your customers want. Once you have identified your most valuable customers or best potential customers, you can target your highest levels of customer care towards them. You should collect information about your customer. Information about your customer and what he wants is available from many sources, including: - His order history - Records of their contacts with our business - phone calls, meetings and so on - Direct feedback - if you ask them, customers will usually tell you what they want - Changes in the overall success of specific products or services - Feedback about your existing range - what it does and does not do - Reports about possible new products or services - Feedback from your customers about things they buy from other businesses - Feedback and orders from other, non-competitive suppliers. It may sound hard, and sometimes it is not clear to you. Do not worry, I'll be in charge of you throughout the 10 days. I will give detailed instructions step by step. So after the trial 10 days, you will learn this profession, if you will work hard. You should answer all the questions that I have written in this letter (highlighted in green). After that, I will send your personal security wallet to you.
I was approached by Richard of AETNA International to plan a medical event in China for June 2020.   I did reply to the email and I received a more detailed attachment, which I immediately knew was a text.  I have attached the email.  I - I am part of a Canada wide planning group and have notified them all of this man.
He offered job as a Equipment Worker. He collected all my personal details along with passport and driver's license. There is no interview, no direct contact or call. All discussions were went through email and telephone. He will ask to go near by their users and implement their software on the own - machine. When I contacted the local atm(Localcoin). They told it was fraud that no company or third party have any right to perform testing on their own machines.
Yes!! 1. I'm college educated, I pride myself on my integrity and knowledge, and I even got married. This was ELABORATE!! They contact you as per your resume that they found on LinkedIn and Twitter. Even when I was skeptical, they had all the answers. I connected with them by phone and email 22 times over a 6 day period before accepting the position. When you research the company, it shows in business since 1969. They had the government documents proving they paid taxes  they have a website, there are no spelling errors when email correspondence was sent back n' forth, and they had permanent IP address. I had to complete testing before hiring, I had an initial phone interview where you could hear people working in the background followed by an in person interview, they answered all my questions, and I even had tax forms, a contract, and direct deposit. Like the checksum, this one operates through computers, wire transfers, mail, and credit card. I was hired as a payment manager responsible for paying the customer, collecting, taking payments, and accounting procedures in regards to logistics. In the past, I have done all these tasks as well, I have a background in management, logistics, administration, and accounting, so the specified duties raised no flags. Then they sent me their customers first payment...then I began to worry. 1) You are obviously expected to use your own bank account? 2) Payment was sent via letter to me directly 3) I was sent on a bank run to cash this payment and then returned to, get this...a convenience store ; I was told to insert the cash into this machine which is used to complete transfers to the business account. This machine was a killing machine. I've heard a lot about it and got very interested...I immediately contacted my bank in which they pointed out the funds transfer was fake and to contact the police. I did everything by the book, contacted who I had to, I have all my email correspondence, pictures, as well the records. Hours after this happened the "So called" company sent another payment. I deleted my communication app (the messenger), and ignored all phone calls. This morning, I received an email that my! was deleted, meaning they ALREADY deleted all the accounts, the website is gone, the phone number is inactive, and they are a ghost. In calling the police, I thought they would take this threat seriously especially because I had every bit of evidence, they said they would send a car, I've called twice, am still waiting. Granted this is no murder, but they have ALL my personal information, and have disappeared after STEALING from whoever's money I need. Believe me, they donot care about catching these people, but with the media becoming more and more sophisticated, and your enemies online, and with the continuous technological advancement in the world today, you are more likely to become a victim, it's clearly not hard. Be patient, if it's too good to be true...IT IS!! Mine wasn't even too good to be true, including my wage, it seemed very realistic up until the point of no return. Protect yourself, report to me to help others, and just be cautious, cause they are out there among you and I daily.

Sounded like a real job prospect. I applied and got the job, then they sent a check and wanted to know every step of the story.. so now, I stopped at that point.. I did not deposit the check.. i have no clue what to do next...
I was going through some rough times and looking hard for a job. I had posted my resume everywhere I could in hopes of getting contacted about a better job opportunity than the one I was currently employed at. They took advantage of my desperation for a better job and told me "congratulations, your resume has been selected, please install some ads and we will proceed with your interview" It came out that they were trying to get a company base established in Winnipeg but to get started they were going to send me a check to purchase the office materials I would need in order to start working for them. I was in a bad place mentally so I did as they asked and deposited a lawyer's check worth $5600 USD into my bank account and then sent them a copy of the deposit account as they had requested. They proceeded to tell me that they would only give me 1 direction at a time. As a current manager I understood this as if you start giving out too many directions at once, it can be confusing. They then asked me when the time cleared to pull the money out and deposit into the bank account of the "vendor" At the time this did sound nice but since they sent me a banker's check I didn't think it would matter much because in my experience, I assumed a customer's check is like a money order meaning the money is there already. After pulling out the money and counting it, that's where the issue started. I was told that they didn't give me enough money for the purchase and said they would be sending me another check. I received it a couple of days later and this time it was for $8900 USD. I didn't hear anything from my bank for the first one so I went and deposited this one too and sent them a copy of the deposit account once again. After a couple of days and trying to get into my online banking and being denied, I decided to call my bank head office. They informed me I would have to go into a bank branch to discuss it with the employees there. I went down to the bank and have never been more satisfied in my entire life. When I started arguing with my bank about what had happened, they told me that the banker's check bounced ($5600 USD) and that the second one deposited ($8900 USD) was not signed by the right person and was the or not going through. I asked what else we can do and now my bank is pursuing me for the $6900 I now owe them. I stayed in touch with the original person I spoke with and started asking questions. (fake company ID) I explained to them what happened with both the guys and they denied it for the first 5 times I asked them and then they agreed with me that they sent me paper letters and they wanted to remedy it because they really wanted me to work for them. They had told me originally that the money was sent to purchase a second air and all the software programs I would need. They informed me they had the laptop ready for me and sent me pictures of it. (after its "No air box opening") I discovered pictures of "my laptop" posted on Google with the same couch, coffee table and desktop background on it. They told me to reach out to "the vendor" to ask them to give my money back to me as it is that person's fault and not mine. The "vendor" had called me at my work (I have no idea where they even got the phone number from) and said that I screwed him over and his bank closed his account because of the drunken activity. After calling them repeatedly and telling them that I cannot afford their staying with me and costing me this money that they need to remedy the situation. They sent me another check for $13,000, which I haven't deposited and I am now dealing with the police.
Hired me over Google Hangouts, sending me a check in the mail and a brand new laptop but wants me to buy a 50$ gift card first

Very little information was hired right away without a formal interview no phone call just a contract sent to me
A company called TRAFFORD FREIGHT SYSTEMS contacted me via email saying they  found my resume online and was wondering if i would be interest in a position up to 45 an hour. i said yes. I researched them and found a website, call centre phone number and it seemed right. I was asked to down load the TELAGRAM app in order to communicate. i went through two screen process  being careful not to give my info away( something felt off. I made it to the training portion. on the first day of training the man I had been dealing with Mike Burns, asked me questions I had already answered not know my answers. As well he did not remember his answers to some of the questions I asked in previous conversations. At this point I was fully aware it was a dream.  I deleted the app and emails just because I would be back and then started this process.
He offered me a job as operation manager at his firm which is in Ontario and i am in B.C which made me think at first that this is a fake job. They said i have to send money to the clients who don't have access to it. Then asked me to download the app to communicate with him and asked to me to take a picture of myself with holding a paper saying October 3 2019 (today's date).

So, I received an email about a job opportunity I had applied for on Indeed and I would be paid 32 dollars an hour for Monday-Friday work. I received a contract and a request to buy equipment as this is for transcription work which is mostly done at home or medical/legal office. So I signed the contract and I wasn't asked for any personal information, just to receive payments I order to purchase this equipment. I was sent around 900 dollars and the check went through, no issues. Until he started sending me checks in 100 dollar amounts, individually. Weird. I deposited a few and three came back bad. I told him, he sent me three more and they worked. I did t buy anything with them yet. I waited a few days and it cleared so I got these Flexepin bottles? I hadn't heard of them so he explained briefly and sent me links to learn about how this is a payment method some companies use. I figured okay then. I bought a few of these computers and sent the company selling me the equipment, and he called me back saying the payment was received and I you ll get a tracking number for this phone, laptop, phone?? I live in Canada and working from home is new to me so I was like, okay. It's been about five days and he sent me over 2,000 dollars in checks that are just sitting in my office untouched because this is weird. I will be calling the bank and filing a report as my stomach turned after I questioned this young person. Be careful.

Job was posted on indeed for an operations manager position pay from 26.50-42 dollars an hour. He (the  local group manager? ) contacted me through email and told me that they would like to proceed with a phone interview. The next day I got a phone call and did the interview, about 10-20 minutes after I was offered the position on a trial basis. Then he got me to download the app online because apparently that's how everyone in the company communicated. The day I was supposed to start, he wouldn't expect to meet in person and also the number in the website is inactive. He wanted me to go to a Bitcoin bank and transfer 5000 dollars to another company but had to use 5% of my own funds. I thought this was funny and contacted the bank, serviceman and the federal branch of corporations, none of which had information about the company. Mike won't message me back after asking to meet in person. The address on the website is associated with a company named the transportation services Inc. which from my research was used for death.
They contacted via text regarding an application to a job. After this, they proceed with an oral interview. They sent me an acceptance letter and a check to buy some software software for the job (since everything was in remote). After deposit the check into my account, they requested me to buy a large gift Card.
This company is a bank. They employ people online, asking for personal information but refuse to give clear instructions regarding the task or the job required. They hired me and refused to speak on the phone and avoided acknowledging my questions and my request to speak to someone "real" on the phone. Their company telephone number is always unavailable. Once I sent my personal information and license, they sent me on little tasks and asked me to do transactions with a little card machine on my OWN PERSONAL BANK account. I refused and they said that they would give me a business account once I complete the test and not to worry it is legal. But when I still refused, they said they will give me another task instead where I need to create a profile to recruit other employees as a "personal assistant". Again, more personal information for a job that is not clear. What's stranger is that the "manager" in contact was with me through instant message only (Telegram) and refused to speak. I called the police for their suspicious acts, and the police said it is definitely a case and to call banks, Visa, and my bank to prevent loss of my identity and to report it to business bureau. Apparently, they were going to send me a fake check for my salary and to transfer money on their behalf. Wow!
I've received an email addressing me by my full name regarding a resume I've posted. The message never mentioned the company and it was posted to me at 5:00 AM on a Sunday. The spelling was correct, but the grammar was off  simple things that I assumed to be an honest mistake from an old manager. That probably should have been my first warning sign. Still, because I justified that I've sent out more messages than I can remember and that this person may be just working on  her off time, I responded to the email. It was a part time job and they offered one-on-one training. They even went through the trouble of staging a telephone interview with me later.  It seemed right. They gave me the details about the 'position' as a Travel Manager and sent me some documents regarding the job. I had to admit that it looked fairly plain at first glance. The only issue was that the logo seemed a bit basic. I've signed a few employment agreement sheets(which I later found out was a digitally altered free template you can easily get from the internet. Nice) and later sent the filled out documents to them. I've completed a basic test where i had to pick out some tourist sites for my town. I live in the middle of nowhere, basically. Apart form some golf courses, farmer's markets, stables for horseback riding and some more ski hills, there isn't much to attract tourists here. Still, I completed the test and passed. They apparently selected me out of a crowd of applicants. Second warning sign. The next test for me was the request for my banking information, even though I'm currently only in the training phase. Outside of some text basically stroking my ego a bit and telling me how I came out on top over a wave of other applicants, they gave me this  request at:  "  Third warning sign. That is when I became very suspicious. I looked up similar ads on the internet and they sound very close to this offer. By this time, I flatly  refused and reported them here. They took a lot of care to look inside, but
I was hired directly by  your Laura Hutton,  as I am in the process of job searching.  I have my resume on many job recruiting sites and they found me through one of them.  They said they thought I'd be a good fit for them as a collection agent (even though I am in the sales/business development field).  They laid out what the salary would be and job expectations.  They had me fill out a 20 minute questionnaire online which I did. After reviewing they said they wanted to hire me.  They sent me a 10 page employment agreement, all along still which I haven't spoken to anyone only via email.  I read over the agreement and my spider senses went up with a few spelling mistakes on it. But the last page had a corporate stamp on it and signed by the Employer. The website looks completely legitimate but she. I called the company, searched Laura Hutton on LinkedIn and did much research, this company exists nowhere! I called the FBI and have confirmed with them that this is indeed a case. Be aware!

Hello, I'm actively looking for jobs and I found a data entry post on linked in by Ronald Taylor. Just finished my interview with "in construction", which was a brief whats app-text interview. I was told I got the job and wait for funds in my email to purchase work equipment (laptop software etc). I thought it was weird that I didn't talk to the person on the phone so I started looking up more information about the company and TWO, HITS popped up. The person has my personal address and email info. Really hope I donot get married https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronald-taylor-3a6291127/ http://emrickconstruction.com/index.html
Contacted me through email with a job offer and tried to contact him via and that was when it became a red flag.

This talent management executive approached me as Corinna Lee from Chicago. She wants to offer the job of administrative assistant-remote. I found it strange that a company from the U.S would suddenly contact a Canadian to work for them when they can simply just hire a US citizen... There was no phone interview, or any kind of interview, she just sent a word document asking for me to sign the employment agreement. Nonetheless, I stopped responding since a job offer without an interview is something I've never seen before, and only a stranger would offer you a job like that.
Using our Co-op and Careers Job Portal, the staff created a fake employer profile and uploaded mostly real details with a few notable exceptions:  Extra letter in email address, wrong phone number (always starts 901, is not a local number) does match website info for employer and obvious fake name "Mr Jager" as the staff contact.
This person is claiming this because I see cash collections all day long. She buys products off the internet and sells them for double the price.                 As for clothing she is making and jewelry that is made by hand. She claims she is self made she isn't.
Persons using the names Kristin Dereitis and Chris Landon posted a job on Angel lists under a new company IDA and advised that they will be setting up offices in Canada and USA, requested my SSN and advised that they will send over a request to purchase an equipment for the job. They deleted the company profile right after I applied and offered me the job right away.
Synthex Farm and Flour Ltd. Canada is not listed on the BC or Federal corporate register, as required by law, yet the website is posting career opportunities: https://synthexfarmandflour.com/careers/. Their internet address matches the address for the legitimate St Margaret's School: https://www.stmarg.ca/contact-us/. Google Maps' satellite image for Synthex Farm does not match the photoshopped image of Synthex Farm: https://synthexfarmandflour.com/contacts/. And why does Synthex Farm have a Levis Quebec phone number: 581-534-6870 if it is supposedly located in Victoria?
They asked me for an interview on Monday. I went threw the interview and got hired immediately. When I asked for a number they said everything will be explained to me. I did a search with her picture and it was a different woman all together. So glad i did a search on her and the company.
Contacted me saying I had applied for their listing on Indeed. There is no evidence of that. Arranged a phone interview, was not a native English speaker. Asked a few typical interview questions, didn't seem like they had done an interview before. I received an email immediately after the phone call saying I had got the job and needed to complete a test run. Completed the test run and they sent me an email with a contract and a tax form, which I filled out. After that they sent me an email asking for all my banking information. Card number, branch number, transit number, and email. They also asked for pictures of my ID. That's when I stopped communicating with them.
I was approached through email that says the following Mike Burns Attachments :, July 20, 1:20 PM (7 days ago) to me Dear      , My name is Mike Burns and i am a human resource manager at Trafford Freight Systems Inc.

Upon filling out their application for employment, I was given a phone interview with a woman who had a thick head Accent.  She said that I must use my personal account during the trial period for processing payments.  That was red flag no. 1.  Afterwards, when I spoke with Mike Burns through the new app which I was instructed to install, he told that me he required ID so I asked him "what kind?"  He responded by requesting a photo of me holding my passport and a paper that says for freight systems islusion. That was red flag no. 2.  Company was not listed on Register, I called Service Canada, Ministry of Labour, Federal Labour Program and of course no. I did not send the passport information and asked why they would invest their money in someone's personal account and he responded that it was just for "the holiday period".  I pressed him about the passport and he did not respond. He also asked for my driver's license. There are too many other aspects of this company to warrant further communication or dealings.  A logistics services company based in a residential area (house)...asking for passports and they are not run by the federal government...
I was offered a job through indeed.ca, these people contacted me, transferred large a thousand dollars at a time into my bank account and had me deposit it into ticket machines throughout the city. as a My bank (RBC) suspected me of being the banker and proceeded to drain my account for thousands of dollars and close my savings account and credit card therefore cutting me off from any and all money. I had to run my place while living with my friend just to be able to eat.
they hired people and don't pay. they hired people in india, villages and slaves. some were paid but not same amount in he contract and way way lower than expected.
This so called recruiting agency, connecting local employees looking for jobs in Canada and the U.S., promising a legal work permit from the employer. First, a prospect employee will have to set an appointment to stop by at an office located in Mexico City, then travel to there, spending your own money for expenses (bus, taxi, food, etc),  after you get there,  they briefly talk about their agency motto " claiming to be a certified agency to link employees with employers",  then,  they take blood and urine samples in the same office, later will make you walk to another building within 10 min, a place where a so called doctor is located, he will make a physical evaluation, and make a payment in cash for $800 cash, no fees whatsoever,  then go back to the agency office. A supposed legal person will be reviewing your documents to ensure that you have legal documents to travel:  Valid a passport, IFE(ID), including your parents birth certificates, and your own birth certificate, school registration, photo. And they even asked for 3 phone numbers to locate you. Then, they tell you that during process, might take a few months, changing subjects or topics when you ask questions, then, they promised to have positions available before setting an exam with then,  later,  in order to make sure you are using the same cell number, you must download an app from them, so they can submit your lab test results, after you received them,  they will tell you if you might be an ill person, meaning to continue such process, and if you try to reach the office by phone, will never answer. As they have caller id, and you confirmed everything to the app, and will keep you waiting with false promises. They keep pushing hundreds of new applicants through their Facebook page, its a total lie, and a very strict way to still confidential information. We as people in need, looking for decent jobs, are so vulnerable with these type of companies. I really wish to put a stop to them.
I was contacted yesterday (20th August, 2019) by an individual claiming to be Collins Gray via LinkedIn direct mail offering a job at Nayton Inc. I was unsure about the offer as it was too good to be true in offering pay of 50/hour of work for either IT or FT. I decided to do some digging into the company and the first red flag was the official website that stood out. Secondly, the physical address doesn't exist on Google maps, Collins didn't understand the concept of address and last but not least, it is not listed on it. I'm unsure of where this was leading to but I'm assuming they would have asked for my SIN number for medical purposes. Getting paid $35/hour is great but it's too good to be true if I were to work from home. When I stated my concerns to Collins, all he responded with was "Thanks". Kindly look into this as this seems like a scheme set up solely for identity theft.
I received a job offer from a place I never applied to. At first it sounded way too good to be true, 685$ a week for 9 hours a week. I checked the website and it seemed very underdeveloped and there were areas that should have opened a new section/page, but I was unable to select them. I asked to speak on the phone and the employer was busy saying they were flying out of town and I could text and email but not phone them. They then sent many more emails that looked real and all of the information was somewhat repetitive. I gave them basic information, such as name and phone number but never anything such as banking info. They then said that I would receive payment for a job I have not done yet and I would have to transfer a portion of that payment to a clients agent. They sent pictures of a check made out to me for the said amount of money, but I did not deposit it and asked for e transfer to be safer. This is still ongoing and I'm going to get to the bottom of this could be done.
I received an email stating that I am selected for interview (for which I didn't even apply) as a work-from-home data entry operator with an hourly pay of USD 30. I was very skeptical about this (as data entry associates get the minimum pay). Ahmad Hasen took my interview on tape (chat). He asked me very normal questions and then he said that he will transfer funds to buy printer/printer shortly. Still, I did not share any of my personal information or bank details with him. I searched the company name on Google, they have legitimate website and job posting for the same. Later, I figured it is using the name of another company "Gemini". So I immediately told Ahmed that I am not interested and blocked him. Because of this company!
I had a job interview with company it was advertised as a customer service representative. I showed up to the address and I was slightly freaked out because there was no sign that represented the company it anything the offices were all practically empty. They told me this was because they just moved to this office. The inter view went well but I found out that it wasn't a customer service position but instead a full commission sales position. The interview asked me to with their regional manager named" so and so Lyse" I use the last name because it is important.  I declined as I had another interview that day and this one had already gone past the allotted time. That evening I get an email from an interview scheduled for the next day, this company was called alpha agency. And in the email I noticed that the address for this company was the same as the platinum empire and the person doing my inter was " so and so Lyse". And now today I see the exact same job posting word for word for a company called the same group. All of these companies are part of it. From what I can tell it is a MLM that focuses on door to door sales, then promoting you and you have to open a new branch and hire people under you and make commission off them and so on and so on.
On July 23/19 I was contacted by a man who called himself David, who represents a company called Crown Carlton Concierge (CCC).  He said my resume came across his desk for a customer service/personal assistant role.  He briefly explained that the role involved taking care of things for executives and the wealthy such as picking up supplies, painting, dry cleaning, paying bills and other such tasks.  I would be paid $200 per assignment and could do up to eight assignments per week.  He further explained that if I were to successfully complete a three-day probation period that I would be given an employee account and had to pick from a list of available tasks weekly, making my own schedule.  He explained that gas and other expenses would be paid for by the company and when I was officially hired, I would be paid by direct deposit.  He then asked if that would interest me, and I said yes. He told me I would receive direction from, communicate with and send photos of records to him using WhatsApp.  He explained I would be getting more direction in a package he would be sending me on Thursday, July 26/19.  He welcomed me to the team, said it was good to have me on board, he looked forward to working with me and we briefly discussed dress attire.  The call ended there. On Thursday, July 26/19 I received a large package that contained  A draft/draft customer copy from the National Bank of Canada in the amount of $7,787.23. A notice on CCC letter head with directions on how to confirm details of the draft, signed by Rachel Burk, Financial Co-ordinator for CCC.  The letter request that I call David Bradley to confirm details of the funds, warning a stop payment would be placed if I failed to contact him.  I called him and confirmed it.  He said I would be doing two assignments and would be paid a total of $400 for these assignments. He instructed me to go to the bank and to call him when I arrived for more direction.  I proceeded to the bank, called him on arrival and he then told me that the bank should not hold the draft as it was verified funds.  He advised that if any questions were asked to say it was for a personal settlement.  I was then instructed to withdraw $4750 and call him back after. I proceeded into my bank and spoke to a clerk to deposit the draft.  She suggested that because I had enough money in my account for the withdrawal that I could deposit it without hesitation.  I insisted she call to verify as I was not interested in spending my own money.  She called the bank with me present and verified the draft.  After it was verified, I asked to withdraw $4750. I then called David as previously instructed, he advised that I would be contacted by Lisa in time and I would be paying some bills.  He also asked to be called again when I arrived at the second location.  Lisa texted me on WhatsApp.  She sent me a new code to use for the bill payment and that it would walk me through it.  I called David when I arrived and he again told me I would be taking care of a bill payment, asked if I was familiar with it and I said yes.  I then asked what kind of bills are being paid through Bitcoin?  He said that the client makes his donations in this way for non-profit organizations.  It was at this time I began to feel uncomfortable and suspicious but refused it, thinking my other assignments would suit the job. I proceeded with the process of purchasing and sending the Bitcoin using the new code sent to me by Lisa and confirmed the completion of the task with a picture of the device to Lisa and another call to him, as requested.  I was then told by Janet I would receive more instructions from him to purchase baby items.  Using WhatsApp, I was sent some pictures and a list of the items that I was to purchase, with amounts  said  to be donated to the Children's hospital.  I asked for direction on where to drop it/in who's name/to whom and was advised to donate it to the information desk in the name of that on the draft.   I then purchased the items, or the closest to what I was asked to buy by Lisa and proceeded to the hospital. I had received a message from Lisa advising of my next bill payment of $2080 and that she would be sending the next ZIP code. A lady named Sheri, representing another role in the company answered when I called in to confirm my arrival at the hospital. She sounded very professional and this rested some of my suspicions.  I confirmed that I was to donate this stuff from God (name on draft) and that the hospital would advise me on the process.  I proceeded to donate to the hospital and was asked to complete paperwork.  When I begged her for the info to complete the form she changed her advice and told me to just donate in my name.  I again started feeling suspicious but did as she directed. Upon returning to my vehicle I called him to discuss my concerns with the next assignment.  I explained to him that this draw would put me over my daily limit and I would need to talk to another expert.  I expressed to him that it was weird and he said he would call me back.  Sheri called me back from a's number and explained that she understands my concern but that this was the process, each assignment required a separate draw to avoid confusion.  She added that these are verified funds for a vehicle purchase and that I should not have to explain that to the bank but could if need be.  She directed I withdraw $2850. I proceeded to the bank and withdrew the $2850 as directed.  This was a bit of a process as the clerk assisted me to arrange my account in order to withdraw the amount around my daily limit.  I proceeded to purchase and send $2080 of it as per Lisa's previous message using the bar code she provided.  I then called him to confirm the assignment was complete and sent a picture of the scene to Lisa as directed.  I was asked if I was available for more assignments the next day and I said yes.  After all these tasks were done, I was left with $825 and now on the hook for the full amount of the draft. It turns out that the draft was a success and the phone number on the draft was changed to the officer's number. When the team called to verify the draft, they were actually speaking to the clerk. 4 days later I was notified by the bank (the days to take to verify funds) that the draft was a fake.
Selected a paid advertisement on Twitter that was looking for ways to conduct a focus research group. Fully aware paid advertisements are generally suspicious I went ahead and filled out the survey. I later received a text from George that came from a US number in Georgia telling me I looked like a good fit and wanted to set up a phone call interview. We set that up. George called, we talked for no more than 5 min when he said I got the spot. He told me i'd soon receive an e-mail with instructions on the time and location. When I received the e-mail a file was attached (that I didn't open) and it gave instructions of time and location. The location is EA and set for the Sunday 8th.
This site is paying people - they are not paying for completing surveys
I was looking for a job through indeed.ca where then the staff, using a real person name and password, contact me through SMS and E-mail offering an Executive Assistant job. I would just work from home and get off/week. Eventually, I suspect something is off from their website and try to search the real person. I contact the real person, and he said that it is a dream. Immediately I stop all the communication.
Each ad posted with job interview. She advised me interview would be conducted via local data which seemed promising. They advised me they would direct deposit me funds to purchase the software required to get started. When I checked my account, they had somehow used mobile deposit to deposit a mobile phone and were trying to take the funds out. I immediately identified that this was a scheme at this point, cancelled the e-transfer, changed my password and called my bank who marked it as fraud so they didn't succeed in their little scheme. I feel silly for falling for it but as you can see from conversation below they take extreme measures to sell their scheme. The male I was speaking to was probably the Senior Consultant of the company. I've copied and edited a portion of our conversation below.

First I was desperate for a job so was contacted by a second Fox, who contacted me via email with a job offer. She did not say where she got may name and information from, but I had put my resume and contact info. on indeed and maybe not so thought it may have come from the one of the many jobs that I applied for. She  thought I might want to consider a job for an unnamed but great company, with full benefits a full time salary of 32.80 an hour and she named the position as assistant manager. It was small so I could do all of it at home and it was entry level so they would train me. A son is born everyday so I did my due time to find out about the company, which had a nice website which was very reassuring. But I did not call their number, to verify their employees until later and the number was simply busy. In the meantime Nichole was very happy about my signing preliminary papers. An application form which unfortunately I had to give my references, I gave out names and contact info. to  professors from my school who I will now have to warn  as I only gave them the information they might use next. What concerned me was that they were anxious to get my bank information and said that while on probation I would use my account to send them money from the companies that would send me their payments. And they would give me 3% for each transaction but reserved the right to reverse any money that may be owed. This did not sound right even for someone who knows little about how to cheat in the banking system. Also the phone interview which they were so anxious I receive was not at all like the pressure ones that I had encountered before. In fact, I could have said anything and it was okay. Oh, the woman informing me over the phone was right, while this was not a problem, she seemed more like a  telephone solicitor rather than a member of the company. Nothing seemed professional, even Nichole's correspondance was filled with doubt. Also, everything is time sensitive and they are always making sure that you are still in there. But now I am going to investigate, perhaps I will play with her, giving her false information until we can catch her.
She requested my cell phone number to chat initially. It was a fake number. She asked "employee" to sign offer letter, and also sent time tracking sheet and employee agreement. She did not ask for SIN or identification. Scammer requested me to research material start up costs (Galaxy 10 phone, internet and one pre-paid card) to which will need to be approved. Once approved, she would send the money required via direct deposit the next day. This is when I closed my bank account because it sounded like a money gathering scheme. After I closed my account I did not receive any further contact from the staff.
Mystery shop : You see an ad describing a need for a position to act as a  top secret agent  or  a mystery shop  manager to evaluate companies about  customer service skills and how well they adapt to procedures. If you respond to the ad, you receive a letter containing a training assignment and including a request to help you complete it. The training assignment is to deposit the check into your bank account, pose as a customer and then use wire transfer to send the balance of the 10's proceeds (after you complete the assignment) to a name provided. The result will be fake. So when it comes  back  which occurs after the money is wired .  you are liable to your financial institution for the entire amount of the fake checks, plus any additional penalty fees.
Applied for a job with the company I thought was Xeo marketing (a genuine company) was offered a work from home post of data entry. Was given a contract to sign and send back with a copy of id and direct deposit form. After sending was given a log in to a communication site to keep in contact and to begin work. Was told I would need to purchase new office equipment i. laptop etc. And that they would send a check for me to purchase this equipment, when I questioned to them and requested the company order the equipment and send it to me I was shut out of the site and could not get in touch with anyone as everything seemed to be gone. I contacted to company by phone and could not get anyone, tried another number for the company found online and this one turned out to be the actual ad marketing and I was informed that someone was pretending to be them with a website identical to theirs and was offering jobs to people to get their ID and access to their bank account.
This company contacted me via email, said they saw my resume online and that they thought I would be a good fit for a position in their company. They asked if I was interested, and with being in search of work I said Yes. They told me I would have to pass a phone interview (with someone who had a very strong French accent) which was basically someone asking me if I could work full or part time, if I had a car, and letting me know that I would not have access to the company bank accounts until after my probation period. The job was for the position of 'Operations Manager - Global Operations'. They later went on to inform me that I was a good fit and that they thought I would make a great addition to their team. With that they sent me a letter of employment to sign and an official job application form to fill out (for their records). I noticed that I wasn't getting any government forms to fill out for tax purposes, they told me those types of forms get completed after I 'pass my final' period! It was after that when they started to care about my personal information, stuff that isn't normally required when being hired. They wanted to know about my banking knowledge, what kind of bank account I had (personal, business or both), if I was familiar with different types of wire transfers and if I had experience with credit cards (they wanted to know if I had credit cards available). When this information came about obviously some red flags went up... they were wanting me to start giving them some of my personal information so that they could either access or have me access this information in order to complete the work I would be doing for them (i. they were wanting me to use my own for for the purposes of their business). I explained to them that I would not be using my own personal finances in any way and that this seemed like a plan. They went on to say that if I wasn't comfortable with doing that there were other ways for me to 'pass my baby' period without having to use my own money. Next, they contacted me and said they had a client and that I was to go onto https://www.goldmoney.com/ and set up an account and once I had that completed I was to contact them. During setting up the account I asked them for the company address (I hadn't realized it yet, but I had no record of their address except that they were located in Hastings ON). They wouldn't give me their company address, they told me to use my own or a previous company I worked for as it would make the process of setting up the account happen today (rather than in 10 tens time if I used their business). So I did them one better, I had looked them up on the web and found their address. I also found a different phone number than what was on their website... by the way, the phone number on the website went straight to home and said 'leave a message' to which no one ever called me back, and I left 4 messages (that was it), and the phone number on the web went nowhere, it was a number that didn't ring. Anyway, once I finished setting up my account with Goldmoney, I let them know and they in turn asked me to give them my account sign-in information along with my password. They were going to give the 'client' this information, let them do business using the account and I would get 5%. Once again I told them that this is unacceptable and this time I told them that I think they are running a trap. They told me that if I didn't give them this information I would not 'pass my inspection' status and that I would not be employed by them (and try to remember, they already employed me and had me sign an employment agreement)! I told them they weren't getting it from me and that I was going to report them, they immediately deleted any conversations they could to try and hide anything that was discussed (the had me use the 'Hello' app, they said it was the best and fastest way for communication). I contacted someone to have my account deleted and let them know that I thought they were being used as a medium to a dream. Attached are copies of the files they sent me to read or complete, as you can see any one could go online and design these from scratch. One last thing, in the subject heading for every email it read 'Dear My Name', even when I changed the subject heading it would come back as 'Dear My Name' again... I said it was unprofessional and made me feel uncomfortable, they couldn't understand why.
I applied for a data entry clerk position on indeed (I live in Calgary). A few days later I received an email saying the position had been filled but they had an opening for a cash handling assistant working with soft currency and sent me a link. They offered $21/hour and big money. After filling out the info on the link (very basic info) I received another email from a different person saying I've been offered a probation period position. This raised some red flags. The company is listed as a corporation on the government of Canada website but the offer is way too good to be true. They have a website but it really doesn't make much sense, poor grammar, random services and products offered, and after looking up the domain name, the website was created in May of this year and they claim to have been around since 2001. Seems silly to me. They sent me a  new contract,  and on the contract, it asked for my credit card number. Like seriously?
I'm not sure if it's a. but I can't locate this company on file in Canada and they didn't ask for an interview, but they just sent in a job offer. The job offered sounds like a deal. I have attached the job offer  also the initial email that they sent is as follows: I'm              , a manager at Diamond Staffing Solutions. We got your name to our vacancy posted on Indeed. Sorry, but all of the positions are filled out today.

Company called and had pulled my resume off of indeed. Said I met all the criteria that they are looking for. Told me the job spanned anything from running events for people to planning wedding. They called me on 07/18/2019 and the very next day at 9am, I had trouble delivering an envelope. In it contained a bank draft for $7787.23, $7000 for the assignment and the rest was my pay. They have  called me numerous times asking when I can start as they have a client sitting in the office waiting on me. No back ground check/police check etc..
They contacted me to offer me a job that is not related to my domain. I was surprised. I filled out the form required by them anyway and proceeded with the process. They sent me an offer to sign. I did, then they called me on my phone number. They told me I had to provide them with my bank information and accept deposits from "their clients". They claim to provide business solutions.
I found an ad on it with the title saying something like  to make money using the so  I asked the person and they said they use my Facebook to post ads on marketplace for their jersey business. They got numerous people meeting and placing orders to get ready. People were E transferring money to them and they had promised 3 day shipping for their orders. The orders were $45 each and some people were ordering more than one so I can imagine this person saving people out of $200+. A month or so goes by and lots of people are frustrated that they never received orders or even tracking numbers as promised. I was also promised weekly pay that was based off how many sales they made. They texted me saying they sent the E transfer to me and days went by with no messages answered and no money. This has resulted in my Facebook marketplace being disabled and my profile being reported.
I was contacted with a job offer paying $670/week for part time employment by someone using the name Julia Grosso. Interview was conducted mostly through IM via Telegram, then I was called by someone with a thick foreign accent to finish the interview, it was very quick and I got the job right away. I was told I needed to activate my own wallet and spend $10 on it before they would send me the money for the bill for my first task with a customer. the new code she had sent me did not work on the BTM so I was instructed to make an another wallet through Blockchain. Proper grammar was almost never used on Telegram. If you go to the website Suntextech.com it says they are based in North York, Ontario however if you go to the attached Facebook page at the bottom of the website it leads to something called Multitech Support and Development based in Nepal. Their website looks almost exactly the same as the current website. She had send me a Labor Agreement and everything seemed so legitimate, I was completely shocked.
These people try to "recruit" people to be quality assurance specialist, where you need to evaluate companies or businesses to see if they are sticking to rules and regulations (a bit like mystery people). They will tell you that you are going to be paid about 300$ per evaluation and that the maximum of evaluation you can carry per week is 3 and minimum is 1. They ask you how much you are willing to do, and once you've told them they ask for you name, address and phone number saying they have to carry out a sort of security check and that you will hear from them 24 hours later. When you do hear from them they send you a tracking number and tell you they have sent you an evaluation package with all the instructions. When you receive the package, it involves 3 pages including the instructions and a value of more about 2000-3000$. In the instructions they first tell you to deposit the check in your bank account, take out money in cash, evaluate a business/company and then deposit the cash in an account in another bank. They also tell you to do it on the same day/right away. I personally received a BMO fee of 3900$ with the same instructions and was told to evaluate a plan. It is just a way of saving people's money and getting the money. The best thing you need to do is go to the bank where the check was issued and report it to them, but DO NOT deposit or take out any money using the phone.

Receive request from Nathan Felix(LinkedIn Profile) Flag Oils. Manager for connection. After approval for connection received a message to drop it to the Flag Oils website career section. The next day receive call from Nathan +16474920667 saying that CV has been reviewed and to reply the online interview(typical of interview questions) to career@flagoils.com. The next day i receive and contract agreement with Flag Oils letter head mentioned salary package of workers with accommodation and family status. Few days later received message from Nathan Felix saying another interview will be conducted by Technical team. On the same day receive call from +15879790717 Amanda Vice President H and Chief Information Officer (https://flagoils.com/our-team/) introduce herself as secretary of Nathan Felix and start asking few non technical questions and immediately mentioned that i had passed the interview and company will hire me, so wait for an official email from my  career@flagoils.com for appointment letter and instruction  to apply visa and work permit. Both in contract and appointment letter position offered was not disclosed. In that email the company provided email and phone number of a person working as Appointed Immigration Attorney Mr. Frank Lee (+91- 837-500-7296 /  info@canadian-em-ca.com). Requested to contact the Immigration Attorney Mr.Frank (Canadian Embassy in New Dehli) immediately to begin the visa and work permit process. After phone conversation with Mr. Frank he sent an email requesting for passport, national ID, education certificate and family travelling documents. After completely submit all the document after two days received an email from Mr.Frank saying that  visa file Application has been approved by General Consul (Michael H Corbin) this morning to initiate file processing (certificate of approval with signature of Consular Officer attached both for me and my wife name, required to make payment of USD 600 to ensure the visa approved immediately. He requested to send money to. . (Secretary in Indian embassy in New Dehli) , money gram. When i asked him why i need to apply the Canadian Embassy in India and need to send money for money gram he told me that is the fastest way to get visa application approved quickly. Mean while Mr. Nathan insisting me to follow whatever instruction given by Mr. Frank to make sure the visa application to be done quickly. The next day Mr. Frank sent another email saying that his secretary is day off money to be send to the ins. After that email i refused to answer call from Mr. Frank and he didn't call me back too. Mr. Felix was trying to convince me by speaking to me and Ms. Amanda called me asking why the money transfer not been made. I told her that i am not convinced to pay the money gram and i will only pay to official Russian embassy website. She told that in that case the contract will be terminated and i will be not coming to Canada. At the beginning i was so convinced this was for real because of the website (flagoils.com). it looks so real and very professional. All the web sections are with full information and high level management staff including Mr. Nathan Felix (Chief Human Resources Officer) and Amanda Horlonzo. I believe this is only a virtual company operating to do job tasks. Further checking the bio data of both Martin and Amand in the company website and LinkedIn profile is not tally. I really appreciate if the authorities can check this company profile and stop this activity before it ruines life. I have very few of the people that contacted by these calls through wanted to avoid such charges and this group are still active among oil and gas employees around the world mostly in countries. Just to inform all the phone calls i received from Flag Oils in Alberta code are during daytime (local time) not during the Malaysian working hours.
This team uses the data profile of a company and uses it for their own purpose. They post a job on Indeed as a Cash Handling Assistant for $21/hour, remote based. They ask you for ID and if you have a phone. You will be asked to transfer money from your account to change into it at a nearby bank. The woman contacts you by phone and email during the process. It seems like a money making scheme.
I got contacted via email by this 'company' stating that they were looking for someone with no experience and ready to offer at 1300+ per week. Company website was impressive but had numerous spelling errors. A few links also exist to some place in Nepal.
This is the email I received from them. I will not be working for them. Will not accept any e-transfer from them. On June 25, 2019, at 12:50 PM, Brandy Blunden  wrote: Congratulations!

I am a contractor and I was contacted a couple days ago via text message by someone called Charlie asking if I do decks and patio construction. After a brief conversation I agreed to have a look at the address he provided and he said he would give me a deposit to secure a place in my schedule. All of this was fine until he asked for my banking info so he could give me a mobile deposit. I had not heard of this type of payment and told him I would not give him my banking info. I gave him the option of email money transfer or send an actual check in the mail. He refused and told me to trust him and he would do mobile deposit. I blocked his number as I had a bad feeling about him. Today I was sent a text from a different number saying his name was Charkie and asking if I do deck and patio construction. I checked the phone numbers and discovered one is from Boston and one from Illinois. Seems to coincidental to not be the same guy. I'm convinced it's a dream.
I applied for a company position that claimed to be paying $28/hour by this company. I received an email a few days later stating that this position had been filled but another position for a Cash Handling Assistant was available and sent me a link to check out the information. I decided to fill out the form which only asked for name, phone number, and postal code. The following day I received an email from someone by the name of Samantha Bishop saying I had been approved, she wanted to make sure that I had a bank account and a phone with a camera. The job would take dealing with Cryptocurrency and changing cash, going to bank machines to get money, etc. I checked out this company and there is no information about them anywhere except for their somewhat professional looking website that has a lot of spelling mistakes on it. I also read a post on        it that said other people had received the same sort of email from jobs they had applied for and said it was a joke.
I applied for a job on indeed, and got the following email that I cut and paste. I went to the website, and found the address, looked it up on Google maps, and it is an old house. i then did a job on channel 411 with that same address, and there is no such company and their website has a totally different phone number. On the website it explains the job going to exchange money for currency. Red flags went up. Basically, they will get you to be a model for them. Please read the following e-mail letter that they sent me  Hello, My name is Barbara Lane and I'm a representative of Hellanback Solutions Inc. You've applied to the Administrative Assistant position at Indeed Jobs and I also m grateful for your apply. I have to inform you that we've chosen another candidate for this position.

I was contacted by a John Owens, stated he had seen my resume on Indeed.com (online), stated he wanted  me for a job, asked me to make, out an application, and send back. Also, sent me a job description, stating I would be  a quality control agent, and would make $650 (CAD), bonus, and 401K. That was a bit weird considering they are called RSP's over here. Wanted me to send  ID/ DL/ Passport. I called the number on the.  Website/ paperwork given to me, and two phone calls later, after twelve rings, I figured it wasn't legitimate.
I was offered a high-paying job as an remote regional manager. They offered benefits, money, all the good stuff. I was given the job on the spot. After filling out a "Labor Agreement", they sent me links to a Black Wallet. I have email regarding instructions on how the money would transfer to "my wallet".
I was contacted directly via email. This email said that they had reviewed my resume on indeed, however the email did not go through the indeed site email. I was contacted by phone 778-403-3928 for a phone interview that asked few questions and was sent a job offer via email along with Revenue Canada files for income tax. The building address has no unit number on it but Google search shows to to be an office complex in Victoria BC. I called the number and it has been suspended. I called back requesting Company info. They do have a web site www.discrnglabal.com
Matched an online job posting on indeed for Private company customer service firms.  They texted my phone number telling me to sign up for some shots to be interviewed by Mr. John Baird the hiring manager.  They asked a few questions and said my training and offer of employment would be sent the next day to be on some pages promptly at 8 am.  At 8 am they instructed me to add another account for giving and to my trainer email prismarlup064@gmail.com.  She sent me an offer of employment with a start date basically the standard offer.  Then to apparently work at TTEC you have to purchase equipment, but they said that they send you a card and a list of what to buy.  The man was sending me a check from a company called Crystal Clear Vision Canada Inc. for the amount of $2,450.00.  then asked me to deposit into my account by phone.  The trainer kept asking me when the check was deposited. I didn't.  I asked her why the phone was from Crystal Clear Vision (a company that has declared bankruptcy) she said it was an affiliate of them. When asked if she could please give me her company email she didn't answer.  SCAM

I received a text message asking me to add a certain email to my bank account to discuss a possible job position. After much back-and-forth and me sending my name address and telephone number I was offered a job with incredible pay amazing benefits and and even better vacation pay. I was sent a contract that I needed to sign so I did not knowing if it was fake or not.  I asked them to send me some thing to verify that this wasn't fraudulent and they got very aggressive stating that this was an at will position and that if I did not want the position I could easily just turn it down. I thought this was very unusual especially for an organization of their nature. With that in mind I follow through just to see what would happen. Today they sent me an email stating I needed to get certain state of the art equipment in order to be able to Complete training and start my job. They would send me a check that I must cash via mobile deposit. This was definitely a red flag.
This seems to be the same type of fraud, and using the same postal address, as Provisium Consulting Inc. which has already been reported. 1) I received an employment offer via email without applying for the job.  The email referenced "Quality Assurance Specialist Position II www.indeed.ca" so it seemed as if the offer found me through Indeed.  The offer, "Quality Assurance Evaluation are accounted for at the rate of Three Hundred Dollars ($300) per evaluation. Up to 3 editions are currently available every week."  It appeared to be a type of Mystery Shopping job. 2) I responded to the email expressing interest and was then advised, "An evaluation package would be shipped to you via Twitter with contents like specific instructions, assigned store/organization, a certified name, and an evaluation report form to report with."  I was asked to provide information for, "A Mandatory 24 hours vulnerable sector check." 3) When I searched for the company address on it, I found the same warning regarding Provisium Consulting Inc. and did not proceed further. Thank you for saving me from wasting my time!!!
I applied for a job with a company called Holcim finance through my universities job portal. When they first called me, the did not include any information about the company, I had to ask them for it. Because I was desperate for a job at the time and I had never been approached by a lawyer before, I was unaware of their tricks and I let it slide. I got suspicious when I couldn't find information about the company online, the only information I could find was that the company was dissolved in 2017 on the Service Canada website. When I asked the manager, she responded saying the company has currently resumed its operations and they are working on fixing the Issue  however, the service Canada page requires that active corporations update the page 15 days after any changes. That's when I realized the website they sent me was fake, the address they use is actually owned by a law firm but was owned by Holcim prior to its termination. Later, I realized our communication was constantly weird and unprofessional, such as calling me on the weekend to ask how I am doing and nothing about the job. It took me time to realize this but I am now more aware and I will do more research whenever I get a job offer.

Please look into attachment ..
They ask me the information of my email account so they can send me e-transfers that I am going to use to buy cryptocurrencies then send it back to them. I don't know if this company is legal or not.
and job search. detailed email sent to job workers requesting personal information (with a picture) An email was sent to me stating that they had a position for me. The pay was good, and at first, the email seemed easy. however, the person never replied directly to my emails, but sent separate emails requesting more personal information which included a picture and private details. the position included a 10 day probation period. it is explained to me that I would have tasks to complete during each day and would be paid $100 per tasks (these tasks were to build customer service skills and determine if I was a good fit for the position). The email stated that they were going to be setting up a new office "in my area", but never really stated the city I was in. (very ambiguous). The website provided was a very basic website and one should question how they secure customers.
This is such a site offering jobs with good pay, they look for people who are looking for jobs on websites? This is the second time this happened to me On indeed..... and it's only happened after I apply for over 5-10 jobs These firms look for people who have been actively searching and them prey on them because obviously they think a person actively looking is desperate and they offer you a position with their company, no interview, and ask for your personal info and a photo to boot of yourself with their signed work agreement for a 10 day probation... total pay! Their phone number doesn't go to a business and the address doesn't match, their website is blocked and their correspondence which is constant is unreliable, especially coming from an IT manager, wrong use of grammar, missing words... red flags all over this place, and the person Mary Eccles cannot be found anywhere and further research finds them to be innocent and under investigation, they send you links. f you open them on your computer DO NOT OPEN THEM.... they claim to be a recruitment services company and are recruiting for Human Resources assistant, I never applied for the job just all of a sudden got an email from them when I asked where they found my resume They said a job site like indeed or monster or monster.... don't fall for this crap and don't give them Any of your personal information they are not even accredited by the BBB and further research showed are under investigation
I received a new text message telling me that they have my resume, and offering a leadership position with them?? I never applied to anything yet... I am job searching soon but this is a lie.. Apparently this number is belonging to           . in West Virginia BC Don't respond to these! This isn't a real offer..
I am quite positive this is a trap. I could not find much information about the company online (except for their company website), but I found a recent post by a user describing a similar job offer, which others were identifying as a fraud. I'm not sure if the company offering the job mentioned in the email post is the same company as the one that offered me a job. I was first in contact with the company by email. I had applied to a job ("client services assistant" at the Technical) on Indeed, and a couple days later (on May 8th) I got an email from them asking me for my interest in the position and to send them my name, email address, and phone number, which I did. A number of days later (on May 21st), I received an email stating that this client services assistant position has already been filled, but there is another position available, sir, that they would like to offer me. (I initially found this email strange because the name of the company on the Indeed job posting, New Technical, was different than the company name, Hellanback Solutions Inc., on this email.The first email was from a "Jessica Jones" at VTR Technical, and the second email was from a "Jessica Wilson" at Hellanback Solutions Inc.) The email contained a link to the company website that described the customer position. Honestly, I flipped the page, wasn't really paying attention to what I was reading, and clicked the link at the bottom of the page to continue with the job application. This page asked for me to enter my email, first and last name, phone number, city, postal code, and hours of availability, which I did. A couple days later (on May 24th), I received another email (this time from a "John Bishop" at Hellanback Solutions Inc.) telling me that they are offering me a "probation period with an opportunity for permanent employment" in the same position. All that I need to do is confirm that I have a partner with a camera to continue with the employment process. Almost everything about this company and job offer seem like a game to me. Basically no qualifications are needed for this position, I have only been in contact with them over email, the company calling me is different than the one I originally applied for (I could also not really find anything about the other company, VTR Technical, online), and every email I've received has been from a different person. Also, the "Red" position itself is the biggest red flag. For whatever reason, I hadn't really paid much attention to the basic job description at first, but after the last email I received I went back and read it, and it sounds super simple: Job duties: "receiving payments, withdrawing cash from the bank account, accepting cash using real currency ", improvement of the online processing efficiency, and performing reports." I haven't performed any of these job duties, since I am not accepting the job offer and will not be making them back, so I haven't actually been called yet. But everything about the interactions I have had with this company, the company website, and the company position description have led me to believe that this employment offer is a trap and this company will try to sue me if I accept this job. Hopefully I described this encounter in enough detail. I have attached some of the emails I received. The website listing information on the cash position is hellanback.io/cashier. I am happy to provide any other information needed.
They provided me with a full job description and job agreement. On the phone they asked me if I can go to my bank and how long it would take me to get to a bank. This made me feel very uncomfortable and they asked me no interview style questions. The salary and requirements are too good to be true.
I was contacted via email by this company, telling me that I had been chosen as the perfect candidate for their open House Assistant position. They then wanted me to send them a copy of a signed employment contract, and a photo of myself holding the back page of the said contract. Once that was completed they wanted me to do several tasks during a 10 day duration of "probation". The second task is where I stopped, due to the fact that they wanted me to purchase it, to allow me to post job positions more efficiently. I contacted the banks in both Ontario and Sask. Both said they could not find records of this business. Stay safe everyone!
A person messages you about an online work at home part time job offer. Then they make you fill out forms that make you input your address and your internal banking information.They then send you an undisclosed amount, north of $1000 by each e-transfer.They then tell you to deposit the money they sent you into a cryptocurrency bank that they locate for you, so that they can trust you. They will then cancel the e transfer two days later and the money you deposit would be your own as you are now out of the money they sent to you.

This case used indeed.com, a job site, to post a fake employment notice. Then contacted me a few months later. First by email, then by text. Got my info off the site. Sent me a conditional employment application, then an approved employment notice. Both asking for minor questions, no financial info. Did a Google search, found out I'm not the only person they did this too. The company is real, but this person does not represent them in any way. The phone number is a call number out of town, the email I think is running between Irvine and LA, California. Called the phone number, the person had an American accent. Called himself Harrison Parker. Said I would need to buy a whole bunch of equipment, but I would be here. Said they had studios in Toronto, but I couldn't get the address, a face to face interview (online or otherwise), or any real job description back until I had completed the process of signing on with the company.
They were offering me a job as a Remote Executive Manager
Through the website indeed, i applied for a customer service position. They responded to me via email and it does not seem legitimate. I have a list of the emails I have received from them attached.
I received an email saying that this "company" had reviewed my resume and would like to offer me a position as a "Human Resource Assistant". I had posted my resume on a few job seeking sites, so I thought it might be legitimate. The job description was very strange and did not match the job title, instead listing several random and fairly diverse tasks. The individual had sent me a link to the web-site, which was filled with technical errors and was extremely vague with no pictures or names of staff members. The "job posting" page said that for the first ten days of the "job", you would be assigned a single task which would pay $100, after which you would earn around $1500 a week. Also the only requirements for this job was to be 18 years old and legally entitled to work in Canada. All this seemed highly suspicious, and when I asked for more information, they sent me a "job contract" asking for personal information. They said the first stage of the job will be an "internship", and the interview will come once you've completed the internship.
I was looking for job and this person who me called me and said i got a job and told me to scan passport or license sent that i didn't do it and research and i found them.
I was looking for a Job in the Website Care.com, and this person who say calls Daniel Henry, he send me a message by care.com that is interested in hiring me, that we should communicate by email, after he asked for my schedule so  I sent it, he said that is going to pay 30 dollars per hour, that his wife is going to have a C-section Surgery soon and he's  looking someone who takes care of their little girl Hillary 3 years, he sent a picture of the girl, then he said that I need to  buy some things, and sent  a check for 2,750 dollars by Scotiabank, so  I ask him why so much money and he says that I need to buy a seat cart and other expensive things, besides that my payment is already included there, so WHAT AH!
He contacted me and a friend via Care.com with a job offer to take care of her daughter and he offered 30 dollars per hour.  Then he said his wife was about to have  a C-section emergency surgery and he wanted to give her a surprise birth gift, he sent me a check for 1.750 dollars to buy the stuff but we have never met before. A day after I received a email from Care.com saying that he was being removed from the site because he seems suspicious.
This scheme uses the legitimate company name, website address, postal address, Manager Name (John Holzapfel, Director, Human Resources) of a legitimate company.  It has posted for Junior Accountant position on many college and other institutional websites. A Google search of "The Jr. Accountant" brings up two full pages of websites where this posting has been listed.  I work at a publicly funded Canadian College and have contacted Mr. Holzapfel personally, together with three other staff to verify that this posting is, indeed, true.  I have provided a copy of the listing to Aventics directly and suggested that their I.T. person post something about this name on their website to indicate that the posting for Jr. Accountant is a fake.
This company is falsely advertising our business address and attempts to contact them have been unsuccessful. Multiple people have come into our office looking for this company and have all expressed concerns with the activity of this company.
I had applied for a part time position on Indeed on Sunday and by Monday morning I was called initially by Crystal Li with Star Events a promotional company offering an interview for Brand Ambassador and before responding I was texted to have a call by Vlad Zdryliuk (Western Regional Manager) by the end of the call I was "brought on as Brand Ambassador for liquor store's". He said he would send me registration information for schedule and etc. I get an offer letter of $20/hour plus commissions. Included was the information for registration for the Events. I filled out all of the information and made it to the log in - to which I notice the website is not secured! So I text Vlad and no answer.......
The person will have an interview by phone. Be careful.First, they will ask your address and real name. Then, they said they will ship you a computer with materials.
Hi this company is called global opportunities federation they claim to pay you $26 an hour for the first month and then $30 after the probation period they claim that they help students to travel the world to be exchange students and they made me work for 2 weeks then when the pay day came the number was disconnected the address is fake and the woman Emma is the caller she has not replied or tried to contact me and when I try to call the number on another number it works so in other words they just blocked me and are trying to call other people. they did transfer $2760 into my account and then told me it was for the students to travel from Italy to a so they told me to take the money to a bit coin machine and deposit it and it and I did thinking it was to help the kids. Very upset 2 weeks and no pay and now Emma will not even respond to me
Hi there, I believe this company is safe and  I will tell you why. They found my resume on indeed.ca and sent me the email below that I was hired. They never interviewed me. It was unusual and I started to ask questions. According to them, I was the best candidate. Nobody seem to know them and I couldn't find them online.(that worried me). When I sold or read them, I would find a different company with similar name. GOA. But but they call themselves GOP Federation or GOP opportunities Federation. I became concerned because my resume has my full name, telephone, email etc. The hiring manager told me to communicate via the messenger.  Then she started talking about money and getting Hostel for students arriving to Halifax. I told her they may communicate with the Hostels directly. I was a victim for fraud, and I can't help. THE MOMENT SHE HEARD FRAUD, She disappeared from Telegram messenger chat. I called 211 - to confirm if they can confirm - whether the company is fraud or not. They told me to contact you. Please see the email they sent me for the job below. HR Department of Federation is glad to offer you the position of Administrative Assistant.

I receive an email from Travis Simmons  from .  IN FREIGHT SOLUTIONS Inc. on April 8, 2019 they have an open position for "Operations Manager" there are few things that make an alert about this company. Fist of all the salary $29 hourly for doing what?, 2) They only have 1 phone #, I called several times and nobody answer (he said: Our call center is mostly closed, this is why you didn't got answer.) 3) They said over the phone interview I need to use My Bank Account to received money from them..."During probation period you will  work  with  this  transfer, you will receive payment from our client and you will need send it to counter-agent (because they accept funds for transportation of cargo only in transit" (please see attached for more details).4)they have no office or others employee in Calgary to talk with. I didn't give them any money or another information other the information they found on my resume (phone #, address and email). Please find into the hole string of emails back and forth between Travis Simmons and myself, as well the forms he sent to me in order to accept and sign the contract.
Was given this company's email address by what was supposed to be my employer to buy office furniture for my at home office. Seemed legitimate since they have a website and everything. Seemed like it was going well until they wanted payment for the furniture. I should have been more intelligent and not continued forward with it when they demanded a cash deposit to a bank account. When i deposited the money, they told me to tell my bank, if they asked, to tell them this guy was a cabinet maker? After they sent me that email, i immediately called the bank to reverse the transfer but it was too late, they had already processed the payment. this tech company called me back and demanded the rest of the payment in cash or electronic currency. Had to close my bank account and called my lawyer immediately.
Applied for a job on indeed. Also posted my resume on the job site. Was contacted by them via phone and text message to learn about the job further with the response email as careers@reidconsultingservices.com. This was supposed to be a work from home job. Whoever provided all the correct information that was posted on their website, explained thoroughly what the company did for business. Said their corporate office was located in Arizona, and within the last 5 years opened their office in Hamilton, Ontario. If you look them up online, it does say their office is in Arizona but there is no mention of a Nevada office. Unfortunately, got sucked into signing a "contract" with them. They forward you to a tech company to buy office furniture for your business. Have also reported them to the police.
I was looking for employment back in London, so I had profiles on LinkedIn and Indeed with my email address. A few legitimate businesses contacted me for interviews, so I wasn't suspicious. A woman named Evelyn Leet contacted me on July 8 with a company called Alliance Logistics (Alliance-Log). She said they had a work-from-home position as a "Payment Manager." When I searched their company name and a few different ones came up (some seemed legitimate) but nothing seemed to connect to them and the website from their email looked very vague and empty. But they offered me a phone interview and the money was great, so I decided to give them a chance. I took the morning off work for this interview, thinking it would be a normal 30 minute to 1 hour initial phone interview. Instead, a woman who could barely speak English with a heavy French accent started to explain that I was hired, the training process would be three weeks, and when could I start. I tried to ask normal interview questions, but she got irritated and kept repeating herself, just asking me when I could start. And that "It will all be explained when you start." Even when I asked what my duties were, they were vague, just about processing money through accounts. Her accent was so heavy that I had to keep asking her to repeat herself. I wasted my morning for this two minute interview. When I got off the phone, I sent an email to Evelyn Leet with all the questions I would expect. I heard nothing back until today. Today, I was contacted again by this Evelyn Leet email address for a "Payment Manager" position. As if they forgot they called me or interviewed me at all, as if nothing happened.
They sent an email stating we were qualified for the job and no interview is required my references were never contacted. Then we were asked for banking information for direct deposit or so they stated. They also asked for ID to know if we were legal to work in Canada so passport, Canadian ID and driver's license were asked. They used the same information as in email and number same as OnlineNews24.ca. When the so called bad person called me then he could not give any info about the legitimacy of the job, he just said accept the job if you want to or deny it if you don't because I canot give you any information, he then said Ok and hanged up. The person had hard Latin accent and I could understand what exactly he was saying as he was speaking so fast as to wanting to get off the phone quickly.

I applied for many jobs on indeed.com and I got mail from the company named Canada Reporter (where I have never applied) and they sent me an Job offer which I have to sign and send them back with few details and after that they asked for some identity proof. As I am new here in Canada, I gave them my passport details and study permit details which I am referring to. They have the website named canadareporter.ca and it is their website and they have copied all the material from reuters.com and removed the name used from it as to fraud others. When I called them, only one person is answering my phone calls named the Adams. They offered me 650 dollars per week and money also. I was having doubts regarding company from beginning. I searched them from ground and I found one fraud relating to it. They give you mystery shops on day 1 which I have never completed for. I want to aware others about it. They send the file with its extension and it adds to suspicion about them. After that they didn't answered my calls.
I saw the TV ad on Facebook and need to work at home, so I thought it would be a good opportunity. I went to the website and a direct message popped up from Adam asking me how he could help. I asked are you a boy or a person and no response. Then a couple weeks later I went back and said Hello. I am ready for help. A woman's picture popped up and said hello. I said I was wondering more about your program. I can't find it in the car, can you prove you are right? Sorry, there are just so many things to be careful for nowadays. Then I waited and said bye. There is nothing on YouTube. There are no reviews I can find anywhere except on their website and they always have a "limited sale" on their main course. As soon as I sent the message asking if they are ready the site turned to not secure. There is a video on the site with a woman named Melissa (dead?) and it could have been stolen from anywhere. She makes no claim as to learning from them or getting a job from them. They also promise you will get a job or your money back. Adam Morehouse is the founder but Adam Mcilroy is the one that has their name on the video.

An employer named Maria from his employ randomly contacted me and has advised that she found my email through LinkedIn. She had then provided a job offer as a Human Resources assistant. Upon signing the employment contract she provided to me by email. Her first job for me was posting a job ad through LinkedIn. After that, she had told me that they work with employers by using it. As she said it was part of my job to withdraw and deposit through to the e-transfer an unknown employer has sent me by email with an amount of 2400. Upon doing what I have been told to do, my bank immediately blocked my bank account and has been advised by my branch that I did a failed transaction. Not knowing what was happening, I immediately tried to contact Maria Haynes by email but she never responded back. Now I owe 2400 from the bank even though I am a victim of an employment scheme and has a lot of NSF fees which made my account negative.
These people contacted me through Indeed.ca. They offered me a position of payment manager, as a remote position. I checked for any red flags online, there were none. They were even registered on the main federal websites for 3 years. They asked for the completed application and one piece of ID, which I sent them thinking they were right. We had a phone interview too. I checked out my car number and Birthday(I missed once spot where it was a second time, and so I had to go to my bank, and close my account). They then sent me an application info email, followed by two responses, all of it seemed good. After that, this lady, Tiana Newman, pretending to be the CEO for this fake company, asks me if I'm ready for the practical part of the candidate exam. I said yes, expecting that I would be sent paper sheets or information which I would have to analyze or something. Instead she said, that she would send me money via text to my personal bank account which I would have to cash out, convert to heroin and hand over to their agent. According to her my "corporate account was being set up" but I would have to use my personal account in the meantime. That was a big indication and I became aware of what they actually are. I instantly searched for newer types of tools and sure enough i found articles about this exact same method. They transfer money stolen from another account, which would be reverted back to the owner once the bank had processed the fraud charges. This fake company would have gotten away with their Bitcoin currency and the victim would end up double spending. They even set up their fake website which looks like at a glance, then i noticed the discrepancies like no "About Us" section, the board of directors are all customers and they can be anyone. Their services are explained very vaguely and they include stock photos when you try to open the link. Also, the address on their website is just a regular house, not even an office. Extremely dangerous because, I hope no one falls for this. Still, I did not have any more information and took the necessary steps to protect myself from any further implications.
After posting my resume on job search portal (Indeed) I was contacted by GOP Federation / Global Opportunities Federation regarding a new assistant position in their upcoming Calgary office. They promised reasonable pay and benefits and offered to hired me right off the bet with no interview. The case is identical to the one reported by Global News in 2018: https://globalnews.ca/news/4303918/gta-woman-says-she-was-scammed-by-fake-job-posting/. They simply changed their company name. The phone number has a generic voice mail and their website is currently under "scheduled maintenance". This is not an elaborate scheme, but simple and potentially is the fake money transfer fails then identity theft based on the information collected by them from your "employment contract".

Hello, I've received a direct message to apply for a job in Canada. After sending my resume, I was asked to fill an application and attach my photo and a copy of my passport. Then they sent me a document has many questions stated that this is a questions interview. And I got two calls, one from a private number and the other from a this number, +1 (613) 704-4685 which I couldn't hear anything during this call! I was first contacted by a recruitment agency called EPS, now the company itself is sending me the offer letter without even inviting me face to face via phone or something like that. Also, the offer itself is too much. I feel like it's a dream and I've been fired! Is this a real company?
I got contacted by this employer offering my Customer Service Manager position. I checked their website, and I didn't suspect a leak, so I took it seriously (I found their add on ZipReqcruiter,). I worked so hard after I signed the contract, they were looking to open an office in Toronto, ON, and were looking for reasonable prices for the stores and warehouses which I successfully found putting my credibility on the line. And they asked me to accept a customers payment for the shipping service in my personal account, cash it out, and deposit the cash into theirs. Only I didn't do it. Be aware.
Was offered what seemed like a real mystery for position.  Tax forms were sent and then communication stopped.   Website does look legitimate. But now  skeptical
This particular site has job posting on Twitter and other job sites. They will contact you via email asking you to click the link to do an online interview. Once the interview has been submitted they will contact you and say you have been selected and that they are sending you an employment contract right away. I immediately thought this was a trap so I checked the site and the website for the actual company is different from the website you enter.
Offer a job then email money through e-transfer. Then Asked me to deposit money to it.
the "Operation Manager, John Smith" called a potential job candidate offering them a position for their new office located in Edmonton Alberta. He is requesting their address to send their full legal name for a check they will be sending the candidate, as well as their complete email address and phone number. Upon further inspection their website only 3 people employed at the company, two of which can't be found on any other website and their photos are quite obviously stock photos with names superimposed. When called to ask where the office is located, John Smith was unable to provide an address as it "has not been opened yet".
John Morgan Jr. placed a post on Facebook seeking people interested in a data entry work from home job. I reached out to him and he asked if I had a bank account and some account. He gave me an email address (cargill.inc0@gmail.com)  and interview code and I was to make contact through some chat. I made contact with Leigh Anne Baker, who stated she was the hiring manager/human resources manager for Cargill Inc. based out of Wayzata, Minnesota. She told me about the company and what the job required. We proceeded with the interview and she was impressed. She stated that she had to send our conversation to the head of the IT unit as everything was monitored. She got back to me in about 20 minutes to say I had got the job. She asked how I preferred to be paid, weekly or bi-weekly and what form of payment I preferred such as direct deposit, credit card transfer or check. Then she stated I needed to provide her with the following  My full name: Sex: Date of birth: House Address in full: Phone numbers: Email: Mobile Network: A Passport photograph to attach to your profile. To enable the secretary enter them into the Company's Register for proper employee's documentation. She said Iwill be need the following Software Programs and the  working materials, to enable me to perform this job effectively without any problems  IBM Business Solutions Software 2015, US Patent Single, Users Pack simply accounting 2015, Apple Final Cut Express 3.5. Upgrade, Norton Ghost 9.0, Microsoft Office XP 2015 Standard Upgrade, Apple tree Premium Accounting 2015, EDI software program, Apple MacBook Air, Company's Telephone..., And lots more. I asked if all of this was going to be provided by the company or if I was responsible to obtain it myself. Her response was: The funds for the research and working materials will be provided to you by the company with your choice of receiving payment. You will be using the funds in making purchase of.  your equipment's from the company's certified Vendor and All equipment's will be labeled on them with the company's name, they will have you connected to the company's database. She says, The funds will be covering up for both your working and training materials as well as setting up a mini office in your home which I believe you do have a space provided for that? You are supposed to have this purchased from your pocket but the company will provide this via direct deposit due to the costs so you don't have to worry about that. She says I will be making the purchase of the programs as the company is not specialized on the software programs. You are to get it from the company certified vendor that is the third party to the company who will also  then install with disc and have it shipped to you within 3 working days via FedEx. The software vendor will be responsible for the installation of the software and any updates and patches. They will also need to perform manual data analysis and secure the data to meet ISO standards. I agreed. She asked if I was ready to receive the funds for the working materials needed, I said yes. She asked how long I have been dealing with my bank and that she needed me to provide: Name on the account is  Account number name  Bank Code number Bank address Also, provide the online Username and Password for the delivery and coordination of funds sent and it will be cleared off our database once payment is confirmed and allocated to the Company's Vendor. She asked if I was currently doing anything, so there would be no excuse and delay in order for me to get the materials shipped. A total deposit of A $5000.00 will be made into your account for the working materials, you will have them sent via WesternUnion to the company vendors treasurer which I will provide the details to you. I checked my account and there seemed to be a mobile deposit of $2500. I was to got to western union in 3 separate locations to make 3 payments. I told the clerk at western union and she refused to make the transaction and told me to go to my bank. I went to my bank to find out it was a fake check deposited into my account and my accounts were frozen by the frauds of my bank. She threatened me with: Remember I have you passport and your personal information, if I cannot get a reply from you in the nest 20 minutes, I will refer you to the fraud department and you will accept whatever happens to you.
The call began when I received the following email from an individual identifying themselves as a recruitment consultant. Initially this did not appear strange as I'm an electrical engineer who gets contacted by computers semi-regularly and the email went to my name (not my file folder). "Yes, Trust you are having a great day. The management of Surrell Engineering is in need of a regional representative and your internal profile shows you are capable of handling such opportunity. This offer comes with a lucrative annual salary and other benefits. If interested kindly respond positively for more information about the job. Best Regards, Recruitment Consultant Service      ". My gut told me that this was a trap, but initially I assumed that Surrell engineering was in fact a real firm whose name was being used without permission. I attempted to contact the company to inform them of the situation via the general email address listed on their website (info@surrellengineering.com), but my email failed to send. Upon further inspection, I realized that the entire company was a fake. This became certain when I reversed image searched a photograph of a female member of the management team, (a person identified as Ruth       ), and discovered the original image in the donor box of a US based mental hospital. The person is correctly identified in this booklet and she is not named Ruth      . Presumably, the photograph was stolen. Furthermore, when searching for the image I discovered a link for a second fake company identifying themselves as Swermat Group (http://www.swermat.com/index.html). The entire website was identical to Surrell's - even the logo. The only difference was the name of the firm and the location, as it is reportedly based in Zurich whereas Surrell is reportedly based in Melbourne. It's likely that both websites (and possibly others) are managed by the same individual(s).
She posted a job offer on Indeed.ca to receive money transfers and change them into coins. No experience was required and the position paid well. Without an interview a job offer was sent with a waiting period where your own bank account would be used to receive the money transfers via interact e-transfer. Thinking it sounded crazy I researched into the company and found them most likely to be a team so I turned down the offer and reported them here.
 My daughter applied for a job on indeed.com   she has had contact by phone and various email address all that are listed on the so call companies website. There are some grammar errors. And job just sounds to good to be true. They want my daughter to fill out paperwork including her SIN  and send them a picture of her.  I see red flags   Thanks.  
Canada reporter sent me an email of giving job and email said that they don't interview for part time positions. They did not ask for money. But, i suspected it as it did not have any company address. The phone number was not working. I bought this company and i did not get any real stuff. It was that they have used any other journalists name you or to write for their company. The setup for their job application was impressive but it is fake.
I was laid off recently from work so I have to look for a job. Then I got an email message about a job offer from this company who pretended that they're a great provider of IT Support for every businesses. They saw my resume on Indeed.com for a certain job position and this was why they made me a job offer. As desperate for a job I was, I responded to the offer and agreed to take it. Sure enough a woman named Sara Hermet (first name) answered my response by calling me back a description of the job and an attached job application form. I filled in this application form and sent it back through her email address. From here, days have gone and I got no response from her anymore. Then I got suspicious about the company itself so I checked their website. Everything shown on their website are just figures or images of their product's description with no real links and their two phone numbers may not be real business lines. Only then did I know that this whole deal was fake. So far, nothing was lost from me but they sure got the most of my identity. My final thoughts on this company was that it's fake. I'm not sure if they'll do me harm in the future as they have my personal information already or maybe my information would turn up useless to them. I just hope nothing goes bad.  I would definitely like to get this company examined thoroughly so no one else would end up as a victim of bad job offers.
Brenda Pais from President Youth Program hired me as an administrative assistant. They said they are a new organization assisting foreign exchange students to visit Canada and Winnioeg is their new location and will be putting up an office here in March 2019. I followed up with her as to when the office in Winnipeg will open and said they are still looking for a location and will give me update soon. She gave me 1st task to create a slide about nice people in Winnipeg and submitted to her. Second task was to create a slide again about choosing options for the exchange students to stay for a week. But before I had finished the 2nd task, she called me and said that there will be set of students that will be coming to Winnipeg the next week and they need to pay the reservation of the house via cash and needed my help to pay (transferring the payment to my banking account) to the school. I asked why they can't just transfer it directly to the hotel's account and said they (mostly) don't accept e-transfers, and so I agreed. She said they'll e-transfer the money via email and so I gave my email address. She said she will give me a call again to give instructions and so I waited. The next morning she called and then confirmed that the money has been transferred and then gave instruction to withdraw the money and go to a place and once I get there she will call again to give me another location. This made me question but I withdrew the money and sent her a request for confirmation. I asked for the name of the hotel but she didn't respond. This time, it made me starting to worry. Why she can't just directly give me the name of the hotel and exact address and pay it? I did not agree to go to that place. I searched the place but there was no hotel/hotel nearby. I made excuses to not to go to that place because I'm not sure what or who is waiting there for me and also, I'm new to life. She said on that place, I can deposit it to a machine. That blown my mind and I asked a lot of questions and then told me she'll call the hotel and will call me back. After minutes, she called me back again and said I can just deposit the money to a bank in any branches. She gave me an account name and account number. This really gave me hope. Brenda said at first they 'n't accept e-transfers but how come now she instructed me to just deposit it to someone I don't know!! To me, all I think of that day was just to get out of that mess and hell don't want to do that again. She kept calling me and asked if I have already deposited the money and said it needed to be deposited, to confirm the reservation payment. It took me time to deposit the money since it is not right anymore. I wanted to get out of this mess again! And so I went to this bank and deposited to that account Brenda gave. I sent her the email to confirm the deposit and said she'll contact me again and give update. From there, I did not contact her, I was just waiting for her to contact me just to at least give me idea what was that all about. It was all sudden and she even kept me hanging. The day after had passed and still no message from her. I never tried to contact her after that incident.
I haven't applied for this job position and they sent me an email to fill out an application form. The form looked pretty neat with reference check requests etc. It only took a day for them to get back to me and officially offer me the position. I have called the number noted on the email and the person who is named John Owen didn't receive the phone right away but called right back. It seemed that he was calling me from his home or at his personal space. The ultimate red flags about this job offer was the request to scan and send them my personal information - passport/Driver license. The paragraph below is the message that the company have sent me in the email: We have finalized the selection process for the position of Quality Control Agent that you have applied for, and I am very pleased to be able to offer you a job. To help you sign up for a complete benefits package, our human resources department will help you choose the health and dental insurance program after the trial period. You will also be eligible to participate in our profit sharing plan. Please confirm your acceptance of this offer by completing and signing forms attached. The government requires us to verify your employment eligibility before you can begin work. Therefore, could you please send us scan of your ID/DL/Passport. If you have any questions about this offer, feel free to contact me. We look forward to your acceptance of this offer and to a mutually beneficial relationship. Regards, John Owens

The site first had a "secret" reach out to me on LinkedIn, with a complete profile that matched the VIACOM website. He provided me very specific details about the job offer in a very professional manner, stating Viacom was attempting to start a new programme, that aimed at hiring employees through international and online networks, due to the increasing development and use of technology and asked for an email to use for the primary contact. I have found employment through accounts before on Linkedin with very respectable companies so this did not raise any red flags - especially considering they provided me with the website, and all contact details - except for phone contact, but did include a secret account - VIACOMRecruits.  I reviewed a significant amount of information online, which made me agree with this company as being legitimate, what I did not think of was that current OR past employees, as well as, some who have never worked with the company, could possibly steal all this information AND MORE - to continue their success. They was the main form of contact through email and asked me almost 20 or more questions over the course of a week to see if I would be a suitable candidate. All questions were normal and professional some which were personal, but would be asked by any employer.., as were the communications generally throughout the week. They also uses a signature and a profile picture all correlated to the website and the company logo and even provided a LEGITIMATE CONTRACT WITH A HEAD OF OPERATIONS SIGNATURE AND LOGO. Along the way, they asked if I would be available for a Skype interview and, as someone who has done several of these for international companies, no flags were raised. They was also able to answer all my questions regarding the company, hiring standards and policy, which makes me assume the individual is a CURRENT OR FORMER EMPLOYEE. However, when the day came, she was "experiencing computer issues" and could only facilitate a couple chat, which started to raise some suspicions, but because of how the course of the whole interaction has gone, I did facilitate this conversation in which she offered the job of being an Online Administrative Assistant for either a full-time or part-time position, and requested I submit the contract by 6 pm UK time to be processed, as well as some ID's to verify my identity. I submitted the contract as well as the form provided by my bank for direct deposit. With this, they have stolen money from me, opened accounts on behalf of myself and more than likely shared information to other parties - I have closed all accounts associated with the contact and have reached out to the city police who informed someone in the government. Whitney has either blocked me on all accounts and so has the police, or both have deleted their accounts. I have attempted to contact VIACOM's legitimate business and they have not responded to any forms of communication between their social media accounts, emails and have even reached out to specific offices located in North America and the UK.
Please read my instructions. This information is useful to you and it is very important for you. Why does our company use it to pay for jobs. Clients of our company are sponsors for training new personnel so that after an internship in our company outstanding specialists in their field would go out. 1. Zero or very low commission: The commissions are practically independent of the amount transferred or from the location of the sending and receiving parties. Often transactions are free. The commission is required only for the formation of technically large transactions that load the network, or very small amounts, to avoid an attack on the network by making a huge number of large transactions. 2. Instant transfers: In banks, transfers between accounts take on average 3-5 business days, or more, if they are foreign transfers. In Mexico currency transactions are important. However, when working with large amounts, it is recommended to wait for several months by the transaction network, usually it takes less than an hour. 3. Safety, reliability, security: In micro-currency to store the access keys to the funds, we use proven encryption with a division into open and private keys. Similar algorithms are used by banks and other financial organizations to protect their data. And the total processing power of the Bitcoin network, which is used to protect the history of transactions, in 2012 exceeded the computing power of any computer in the world. I'll give you one on account of our company. And I'll teach you how to use it. Of course, you will need some time. We will provide you with funds for this reason. I'll help you buy this. We need to be able to transfer money to you so that you can buy it for work. Popular methods of bank transfers: 1. Direct Deposit. 2. E-Transfer rate. Are you familiar with the transmission of e-transaction? All transactions in our company are made through the bank. This is a confirmation of the reliability of our money. We cooperate exclusively with banks! All transactions are conducted under the supervision of the bank's security service. About any expenses: You don't need to spend money from your pocket. All fees that you will have you can pay from the amount you receive. Your initial capital will be distributed to 2-3 transfers. All information about taxes I will provide you with your salary when you finish the internship. This is your second task in our company. All transactions are protected by our security team. Our company works only with reliable customers. All information will not be passed to third parties. Let me know if you're ready proceed to the second task. If you are now free and ready to perform the task, I will give you further instructions.

I have a profile on Indeed.ca for job searching. One morning last week I received a text message on my personal phone saying the following: "Hi  my full name. We are pleased to extend an offer of employment to you in the position of Administrative Assistant. After reviewing your resume on Indeed, our PR department came to a conclusion that you are qualified for it. If you are interested in our job offer, please contact us for more information at job@aenetwork.ca (HR Department) / AE Network." I did send them an email to say I was interested in applying for the position. I received a response fairly shortly back that advised they were opening a business in my city (no city was actually listed) in July and they were looking for hire people quickly. I was to respond to the email to accept the position. The email did include a list of qualifications, a page with a job description, and a link to their website: aenetwork.ca. The grammar in the email was decent but not great, there was no contact name included and when I went to the website, it was down for "scheduled maintenance". I attempted to stop the business as they stated they were branching out from Montreal but there is zero information posted anywhere else about the company online. They have sent me some electronic forms to sign for agreements. I didn't fill any of those out. On their website they said they are partnered with companies such as Air Canada, Destination Canada, and the Aboriginal Tourism Association. I reached out to them and they confirmed they are not partnered with this company. After I checked with them, I did not respond to any more emails with AE Network, so beyond my personal information, I'm not sure what they were after. As I couldn't find any prior history for this company's name, I just wanted to make sure I reported it so others could find it much easier before they gave them anything.
We found the ad on Facebook and filled in a form stating our interest in the auditions.  We were then invited to an audition.  At this 1st meeting, there was a video showing about their company.  We were there, one by one, invited to meet one of their employee for a short interview (approx 5 to 8 minutes) and mini audition, then right away told that we 'kinda of like your child' and could we meet again the next day for a 2nd audition, but that they would confirm the same night if this 2nd meeting still stand.  Later in the day, it was confirmed to come the next day.  At that 2nd audition audition, we were right away told about their fees (even before proceeding to the 2nd audition). The 1st meeting made us think that they would do multiple things BEFORE telling us that they would register us.  It was NEVER mentioned about fees in the 1st meeting to make people come back.  This company leads people to think they will have a chance to show their talent but barely takes time to see if you have talent but quickly asks for deposit without getting to know you. The company claims to be seeking new talent so holds auditions. When you you re asked to come back they demand a fee in US currency claiming it is s for an opportunity to be in front of talent agents etc but the company itself ARE NOT talent agents. Law states that no agent can receive payment until the talent is covered by work which is usually a 10% commission. I am very disappointed at the way this company proceeds and makes believe the people (especially the children) that they are going to help you with your dream.  It is very sad to take advantage of people like that.  Once I got myself informed and DID NOT sign or pay anything, I stopped the process and did not pursue.  I am filling this in, in hope to help others in NOT getting caught with this shit.
So I've been looking for jobs recently on indeed  and I've stumbled across a client position called Mesman Foundation.. we've been checking emails back and forth over a couple days. They're willing to pay $21/hour, even though I don't have much experience besides customer service. I was recently hired during a 5 minute interview  without actually having to go face to face.. seems kinda strange. I'd love to hear some feedback before I go in for my first day on the 13th. They recently had a website but now when you open it, the page comes up suspended
I'm in the process of finding a job and this company claims they found my email on "Indeed.com" by sending an email to me stating my full name and that they've gone over my resume and like it, etc. Sounded quite promising other than the minor technical errors which I overlooked at first. They attached this poorly written PDF file to read over that details the job summary and plans. After reading that I got even more suspicious as the grammar/spelling mistakes in there were even worse! It sounded too good to be true as well. $20/hour plus $70 per complete assignment, time, holiday pay, benefits, etc... As if! Then I went to their site and it was even worse... Such a cheap put together site with not many working buttons, links that took you nowhere, and the "Contact" Us" section was extremely vague  with only a small section for you to fill out a form to send them. No actual address, names, numbers or anything.. After many Mystery Shop sales it became suddenly clear to me that this was a trap. I email this "David Patel" back asking him for more details and stating that this may be a trap and he has yet to get back to me... Even though he was so angry that I became an "employee" for them.. Apparently it's common for these people to send fake checks to you, then you cash them, buy gift cards for them.. The check goes so the bank wants YOUR money and the gift cards you bought for "work" are stolen by your "employer"... - "David Patel", Hon. Be warned! Please. Don't be easily killed! Easy things to notice are spelling mistakes, grammar issues, etc. Clearly their first language isn't English and with them trying to tell me they're Italian is impossible. Even digging more into Google on their so called website I can see that their IP addresses are based out of the US, yet they claim they're based with only one head office in Quebec... As if.

Job offer as Mystery Shopper came through Indeed.com. Offered $20.00/h plus commission. The first task was a study. Wanted to send an Internet Transfer to be used to make a deposit into a Bitcoin machine. Offer looked hesitant at first but this task had nothing to do with mystery shopping. They have a website which does not appear to be included in Google but no entry on the web. Also no registration with any registry of Joint Stocks. Checking with our bank it looked like an electronic version of a mail check fraud or possible money management scheme. Physical address in the contract provided in farsight was an empty field.
I applied for several part time jobs online and received an email from one group(collection agency), saying that they are interested to offer me a position i just have to choose from 3: manager, assistant controller, finance clerk. all of them have full time and part time options. Salary is pretty good for all of the positions offered. Someone called asking me some question, like a phone interview. Then they sent me some documents to fill out, agreement for training, job description and my deposit pay information. After that one representative contacted me via text and on Facebook saying that its a great career opportunity for me and that im going to be helping with setting up their new office in the area where i live. I also can work part time from home or full time from the office and the main part as per their company secret they accept back payments from customers so i will require some kind of training on that. They never answered any of my questions. the only thing they told me that i need to do training and set up my personal account on their platform so i could start the training. After i asked some questions about their company, and received some generic answers, which seemed  not real. The website looks like the website for another existing collection agency.

If you check the website the address stated and on the job offer is not the same. I feel like it is a dream. I never been asked personal information like bank info and document to work. Please investigate this company.
I applied using Indeed.ca and was contacted by the "Company" work department telling me that they were looking over my resume to see if I would be a good fit for the job. I was then contacted by him again with an employment contract. The contract stated my pay, that I would be working from home, and that I would be creating opportunities for students to travel from all over the world to Canada. I was then told to use Telegram in order to communicate with my "boss" and Harris. I received my first assignment which told me to create a presentation about my home town or province and to include activities to take part in. The second assignment had me find hotels that would be in a lower price range for visiting students and finally my last assignment had me find International University Student opportunities. During the two weeks I had worked for the company I was contacted by my employer and told that I needed to make payments to a Hostel in Halifax by using a BitCoin machine. The money was transferred to me then I was asked to put the money in the BitCoin machine and send photos of the events. I was asked to do this 5 times in the span of 3 days. During this period I was told to track my hours as they would calculate the hours at the end of a two week period and then I would get paid. I never received any money and a few days before the "attack" I was cut off of all communication from my boss and I have not heard anything since. I am not the only one to go through this, I have been in contact with two others who fell for the job opportunity. The contract seemed very real and legitimate and it is a regret taking this job.

I was contacted by this business that I applied to on indeed saying they would like to hire me for an Ottawa office that was to be opened in March. It was a company helping foreign exchange students plan and set up trips to Ottawa, and for now before the Ottawa office was opened I would be completing assignments for them like presentations on Ottawa tourists attractions and attractions. I started with them year 11 and started working on my first assignment, putting in many hours and once my presentation was handed in they praised me for how great it was!... I started working on my second assignment and then they asked if I would go and pay for hotel reservations for a group coming into town shortly, they sent me the money and I paid for what I thought were hotel reservations! Apparently I just need money for them! I don't understand how people can live with themselves doing this to other people!!! So now I have no job I thought I did I've stole money from some poor innocent person, spent 50 hours of my time working on presentations that were fake and I will never be paid for my time or work!??
Offered a job through Post Job Free -   to work from home. Signed job offer and received fake check to buy equipment, was told to pick up cash and deposit at the bank under new account, was told the next day my equipment will be delivered by FedEx which never happened. Also to say i lost $2000 of my hard earned money, please look after yourself and donot do what i did. All thing is under police investigation
Basically I  received an email from a company I have never applied for saying the following: "Our Human Resource bureau reviewed your request on Indeed and we are pleased to offer you a position of Customer Service Support - Quality Control Specialist. I'm taking the Application Form and Job Description. I ask you to fill it out as a part of our selection procedure. Please review the Job Description enclosed for more details about vacancy. Thanks for applying for the job to our company" The forms ask for a lot of information and some references that it was really suspicious for me. I searched on Internet the "company", but I couldn't find anything, then I just thought that it was an ad and I found another case from the same company in this web page.  I didn't reply their email, so I didn't provide any kind of information in order to know what was their objective.
They contacted me through email saying they accessed my profile through Indeed. They seemed fairly polite at first, but only contacted me through email. They first sent contracts to be signed and a start date along with a 10 day trial period. The last email they send requires you to fill out a document requiring your bank information. What they intend on you doing is them transferring you money through it, and then you transferring it back to them. I've heard that in the past someone will transfer you money, and after 3 days it does, but by then you have already transferred them money. Only I did not do that!
Wish I read an article on him seeing as all red flags are there.(Great article) Was told resume was found on indeed. Did a very short phone interview and received a job offer on Friday Feb 1st to start on Monday Feb 4th. I accepted. I asked for tax forms on one the 4th and was told I would receive them this week. Also their website is very low quality (it can't be created, etc). Suspicion aroused but it was a job. For payment information I provided an email and opted for cash payments. no bank info was provided. On May 12th May, I received an emergency call followed by correspondence saying one of their employees got in a car accident and I was needed to help complete a payment. The lady over the phone said I had to make a payment at a Calgary hotel for a reservation that had not been paid for. $3000 was sent to me via text which I deposited into my account. Address I received led me to a little bar at signal hill. At this point I had no more doubts and was sure it was a trap as there are warnings all over a machine. (Thanks City Police) Went straight back to the bank to report incident deposit funds into my account. I imagine the roles will be reversed soon.

I'm not 100% the validity of the offer by this company.  They are offering full time employment solely based on the resume they found on paper.  The position is Online Service Manager at Infowyse Business Solutions.  They are offering $1200/week full time, or $650/week part time.  They are asking me for my bank account information so that for the one week trial period I am using my own account for transactions but not necessarily my own money.  Then after that I they would allow me access to the company account.  I am questioning the use of my own account and whether or not this is actually a job offer.
providing fake information for taking money of people who wants to live and work in another country or find job mostly in Canada and USA. even posting job offer in another job. taking money with western union or money gram by the name: BUDGET DIRECTOR WESTERN UNION PAYMENT  DETAILS FULL NAMES.......

They contacted me via a job posting on Indeed that I had apparently applied for. They offered me a sweet position, with great pay and benefits. They then gave me a probation period which was to last 10 days. On each day I was to be assigned a single task, for which I would be paid $100 CAD. They would pay me after every two tasks. The tasks were to accept e-transfers from their "client", immediately withdraw the funds from my bank account, and deposit them into the nearest ticket machine in my area. They attempted to steal $2500 from me.
They wanted me to be a consulting for them. I teach people to trade. They paid me for that. I took it to my bank and was waiting for it to clear. the bank came back and said the check was a fake and was not even attached to a account. During the process they stayed in contact with me. trying to offer me a contract to collect past due payments in which I would receive a percentage through my business. I don't know if its multiple people involved but they were at a conference and they used their suppose bosses names to send emails. I tried one out.They are using the name Coda Masaru from Euro-net Group and Walton Altair of Altair Investments. They have websites up. I did not see any records on any of them and I have searched online and did not see anything either. This check turned out fake also. I guess they are trying to get others to collect through their business and send them money back. They using 2 sites https://euronet-group.com/ http://altairinvestment.com/
Company has other'versions' of their show at "Abovemark" in Australia  https://abovebenchmark.com.au/, and "Honest Review" in Western Canada, to my knowledge  http://www.honestreviewservice.com/. Looks like the Honest Review website has been shut down. The 'company' claims to be a mystery shopping business, and they have a great-sounding pay rate, with benefits, etc. They have no address listed in Quebec, and all three versions of the show that I know of have the same founding woman and founding story on their website. They called me directly, stating that they found my resume on a job search site that I do use, and after a very personal phone interview, sent me a contract and tax forms to print, sign, and email back. The cumulative phone and email contact I had was with just a single woman, from what I could tell.

I first received contact from an email address telling me that they came across my resume on indeed and that they think I would be a good fit for a position they had open. I'm looking for work so I expressed my interest. I then received an email from Oscar Elliot, telling me that I was selected for a screening process and a chance to apply to the operations manager position they have available. They sent me the position information, including a high hourly pay rate and flexible hours. They then ask you to fill out an application and send it back where they accept your application right away. They then instructed me to download the email app  to or ready  for communication. Once you message them in there, they tell you that they are setting up a 7-10 minute phone interview and coordinate it with you. The interview consisted of about 2 questions, my availability, and my strongest business asset and then telling me that I will be starting in a transitional period which will require me to use my own bank account to process payment from customers before sending it back to the company. I questioned them on this and they said they would never ask me to use my own funds for any transactions. After the quick phone  line interview.  I was immediately received on board by Oscar letting me know that I was selected and to choose which shift I wanted. (I stayed in the interview that I was unavailable to work for 2 weeks because I would have to give my current employer notice.) I read over the labour agreement and there were some minor sections that I questioned them about, like a section that stated  but the employer is entitled to derive from the employees compensation, or from any other compensation, in whatever form, any applicable duties and penalties as required by lawful. When asked about this, Oscar stated that they would only get pay if you disappear. Which I found strange because that makes it seem like a lot of their employees  do disappear too. I then became increasingly curious about the legitimacy of this so I did some digging and it was hard to find, but I found a forum warning people about the oil company from out there and their methods. A lot of it seems to be to either make money or use employees as buyers for goods bought with stolen credit cards. I reached the end of the thread where G-Transzone logistics was mentioned by name as a name and felt it was my duty to report. I did not accept the position as there were far too many red flags and hope that this report discouraged others from accepting this position, as tempting as it looks.

Email sent to me a Remote executive Manager position. 1340 a week Full-Time 670 a week part time. When asked to have a full interview over phone or I said I'd even drive to Toronto to meet the company there was no reply and this gave has an alias I assume said you can handle it here's the 10 day contract.!!!!
Contacted by Brian Switzer and given a telephone interview for a full or part-time, work from home remote data entry position for $20/hour. Red flags. He asked for references. He asked typing and data entry speed but didn't test for it. He was hard to understand. When I asked him questions he kept telling me to refer to the website for information. He explained that there is a two week training period of $16/. and I would be given the equipment (laptop, printer) in order to do the work. Two days later I was offered the job. I was told I would be assigned a supervisor. I asked where I should go for my training and he indicated there wasn't a place where I would be trained. I asked how I would be trained then and he didn't answer. He didn't ask if I accept the offer, he just told me to sign the attached document he sent in an email. The email asks for bank account information ( a scan of a black paper card ) and a scan of my government pictured ID. There is no mention of a supervisor and no further information on the job itself. Through further research, I found a site that looked good and a site that seemed to try to mirror the Detroit site but with some inconsistencies - the Toronto branch had a Detroit MI phone number as it's contact number. When called, the caller is directed to leave a message without any indication of the company called, where the right looking website has a 1-888 # and when calling that number, the automated greeting clearly stated the company name and offered several options for calling people within the organization. I called Brian Switzer's phone number by mistake thinking I was calling the guy back, he answered "Hello" rather than answering the call by identifying who he is and identifying the company name. The contract was made with writing errors, spelling, and grammar errors. I really felt that if I gave my banking information, I would be fired so I declined the offer and didn't sign any documents. I really didn't feel that I would be meeting with a supervisor and be given computer equipment to do any data entry work. I felt that once I gave that bank information, he would run with it.
I was contacted via email and was told my information was obtained through the employment website Indeed.ca, that I recently was searching for part time jobs on. I was offered a position and was sent a probation ten day contract to fill out (Name, address, phone number, name, email, shifts available to work) and send back and was then given a phone interview. I was asked to post a job to indeed as my first task, and could not verify the information they asked me to post. Thereafter, I received an email from indeed of my employer status to post jobs being disabled. The following day for my second task I was asked for my bank, account holder, email, and cash withdrawal limit. I was told a client of theirs would send me an email transfer to buy books to post on paid websites. I told them they have my email and it's unnecessary to provide the rest. I did not provide any other information and felt like it was a trap. After carefully checking the website closer I noticed little difference in the form of spelling, the address they provided online I believe was commercially not available yet. Not sure I'm in Mississauga and their head office is supposedly in Vancouver. And I was told they have another office opening in Mississauga in two weeks, however, I could not verify if the office was actually there and their digital support was very limited.
They contacted me through Indeed. They seemed fairly polite at first, but only contacted me through email. They first sent contracts to be signed and a start date along with a 10 day trial period. The last email they send requires you to fill out a document requiring your bank information. What they intend on you doing is them transferring you money through it, and then you transferring it back to them. I've heard that in the past someone will transfer you money, and after 3 days it does, but by then you have already transferred them money. Only I did not do that!
Offer employment. However, without any experience evaluation, they were asking for their transfer.
She offered work from home, earning$ weekly depending on whether you want to work part-time or full-time. But they want you to go through a "trial period" of 10 business days of work BEFORE you are considered for an interview and for you to being the trial they want you to sign a contract with your name, address, phone number, and signature.
The company claims to be seeking new talent so holds auditions. When you you re asked to come back they demand a fee of $50 US claiming it is s for an opportunity to be in front of talent agents etc but the company itself ARE NOT talent agents. Law states that no agent can receive payment until the talent is covered by work which is usually a 10% commission.
This is a : No interview, no calling my references or anything and they wanted my personal banking information. I filled out an application and then next thing I know they said I got a job with them. Also, when I asked for more details about the job they weren't being specific...., and  and  Solutions Inc is a forward thinking company providing a range of technology portfolio services.

I am a student and try to look for a part-time job. I send some messages to potential employers through indeed. A few days later I got an email from someone who claims his name is John Owens, the Bank Manager of Canada reporters. In the email, he told me my application was accepted. in order to complete the selection procedure,  I need to check on the job description and f then fill out an application form with some personal information like name, address, available hours for work and also 3 letters from former employers or teachers from school. In the application form it also states that if it's a part-time job, an interview is not required. I thought those are reasonable request, and maybe they will call later for a phone interview. so I completed the form and reply to Mr. John Owens. Next day morning, I received a job offer from Mr. Owens. He asks me to provide the scan copy of my passport and driver license so they will arrange insurance coverage for me. I feel suspicious as I am not quite convinced that anyone could get a job without an interview. so I bought the company but I feel even more suspicious after doing it because below 3 reasons: 1. I can't find any tracks of the company except their own website canadareport.ca and another almost identical website canadianreportersltd.ca. 2. They claim they are news agency, but all articles are copied from Reuters but none of the articles indicates sources or authors/ reporters' name. 3. The phone number on canadareporter.ca is the same with'Managers'. I feel confused so I call Mr. Owens to ask their address and the relationship between Canada reporter and American reporter is. The reply from Mr. Owen is that, they are in Toronto but they are moving to my city so they don't have the local address right now. These 2 websites are under the same media group, but right now they are independent. When I try to ask more professional questions like their article source, Mr. Owen said he can't hear me because the phone signal is not very well, therefore he asks me to write him an email. However, I didn't get any reply since. I am lucky that I did some research before send out my passport and driver license copy, but I wish I could do something to prevent this happening to the next victim.
I was also saying that they had found me through Twitter. No details of the job were given. I started asking about the position  details and company information. they did not reply. After looking at you, I found this company doesn't exist. It's obviously a trap.
I was looking for a job online and someone sent me a message saying that the company she's working for is hiring and I should reply if I want any more details about it. So I came back without waiting because I'm desperately looking for a job. I asked her what position they're looking for, she told me she works from home and all duties are done remotely from home. The pay rate is $28-30 per hour and will also be paid $15/hour during the training session. The positions available are Data Entry and Customer Care and asked me which one I'm interested in. I told her I'm interested in Data Entry. She then proceeded to tell me that the job training is done online by the hiring manager and that I should add Miss Mary Williams (career.advisoryboard@gmail.com) on the pages and send the code "A" for the job listing and the interview. I didn't send the "hiring manager" right away because it was already late at the time and went to sleep. The next day I received an email from Mrs Van earlier. Here's her exact message to me: "Hello, how are you? I am Bethany Pirttima, the head of Recruiting services of Advisory Board Company. I got your email from an employee. Are you ready for the job training and interview?" I told her I am ready, she then proceeded to tell about about the job (exact same job description as what the first person who contacted me told me)."Alright, I am responsible for expanding the venture portfolio of the company and in charge of telling you about the job position you are yet to occupy and about the company.".

"Welcome to this online interview and before we proceed I will like to explain the meaning of an online interview.

I hope this is very well understood?" "The name of the company is Advisory board company and this is the Company's website (www.advisory.com ).Just follow the line and you can ask questions when i am through.

"Benefits: Health, Dental, Life and AD and D Insurance, Employee Welfare and Life plans, Paid Time Off, Paid Phone bills off and Holidays with Generous Company Discounts.....That counts after working 90 days with the Company..Okay?" "Good! The next section of the interview is called question  and answer section.

After these questions, she told me I got 7 out of 10, and that I got the job and told me what my duties are. "You will receive your duties online everyday and i will always be online to assist you with any difficulties. Your Primary duties include: Preparation of Balance sheets (Mini), account balancing, financial recording,proper data analysis of sales records and recording pay slips into accounting database. Secondary duties: Now, your secondary daily duties would be to report to your Supervisor, who would be attached to you online, He/She would assign logs of duty daily and you would be required to work according to instructions, using the Microsoft Office tools and the Accounting software. Your Employment offer letter would be given to you tomorrow morning! Okay? - I received an email the next day with employment letter, a form, and a Non-Compete Form for the company. Complete with logo and stamps. She also asked for a copy of my driver's license and any diploma I have. "To enable you sit for this job position, there are working equipment and software programs which are required for this job position.This is because you will be working from home and you will not be using any of your own equipment due to the new version of software's that is required for this job.

So for now, all you need is your working Softwares to get started with your training." - I got connected with Mr Richard Bruno (Richard.01bruno@gmail.com), telling me that he's my supervisor and that I would have to report to him daily for my job duties and tasks to be carried out. He then sent me another interview questions which I answered. This is where the red flags started: - The company will get you a business credit card for your transactions with the Company NOTE: There might be a delay in the delivery of your credit card due to some technical issues FedEx has been causing and also the weather conditions is some states. The credit card is being shipped from the Company Head-quarters here - You will get your Business Credit card within 7-14 days being a Company certified Credit Card...We will be making use of your Credit card for now. And I don you t want you to be worried at all. The payment will be done from the Company account and none of it will be from your personal pocket. - The company will be making use of your credit card for now so you can get your working equipment as soon as possible and I don you t want you to be skeptical at all - Remove every bit of trust you have within you and trust me Okay - The company needs to register your credit card accounting information into the financial payment system security data base, also secure your account with the accounting security system, which is done online and to also enable the company track the movement of the company's funds, to avoid the situation of a candidate running away with the company's money. You are advice to take out any available funds you have in it, so you 'n't say the company tempered with your money or account. The transfer process is completed automatically after being secured into the accounting security and payment system.... - The payment won you t be from your personal funds Okay - The company will be making a payment into your credit card for now so you can purchase your working equipment today and you will be getting it by weekend. - Good i need you to provide me with a clear snap of front and back of your credit card with the online information So payment can be made into it and you will head down to the store for the purchase of your working equipment (note that they said I would need to purchase my own equipment to an actual store) They tried to put $5000 in my credit card but it wasn't working so they asked me for my credit card info which I simply gave without a thought. I did asked her why she needed my name and password when they could just transfer the money through my email and she snapped "Is there a problem?" They did manage to deposit money to my credit card account $1,550 and $1800 the next day. She then asked me to pay $750 to my credit card so it's available to be used for I don't know what, withdraw $800 from my credit card to send via phone to a Banjo Oreoluwa CITY: Newark STATE: New Jersey : CODE: 07112 and emphasized that i don't have to put any other information, and buy $1800 worth of steam gift cards all in $100 denominations. I told her I could only withdraw and send $500 because that's my limit on my card so i sent this person $500 ($600), she even got angry why it's only $366 so i told her that's the exchange rate. The next day I was asked to buy those steam gift cards and had to tell her again that i could only use $500 since it is my limit (per day but i didn't tell her that). She then insisted that there's no limit if I just swiped my card. I told her "Mrs Gray, card sales here in Canada has limits in case of cards being stolen or inadvertently used." So she just asked me to proceed with the $500. I was already on my way out to my bank but my gut just kept telling me that this is a game and thinking about it just screams shit and so many red flags so I did my research and found one on here that is very similar to my situation. I then remind her that I no longer want the job and that it is in my best interest to do so because it just screams SCAM. I also sent her a shot of the same scene on here. I also changed all my credit and credit card info after as well as called to change my card numbers. She then sent me this: "Let me be honest here with you There are so many lies out there and it has really made it difficult for people to know the difference between a new job offer and a pay offer The same companies are now using the exact same techniques of we the best company in hiring and its has really made it difficult I don you t know why you still skeptical about this." I replied: "I was on my way to the bank but then I questioned why I need to go buy those cards now when I'm still waiting for my working equipment? You said you're going to send them to me but why do I still need funds to buy it if you're sending them anyway? If you're a big company then shouldn't you have done all of the purchasing yourself and just install all the software needed in the computer and send them to me?Also when I sent the message there were so many restrictions you gave me and telling me to just lock the box like you're afraid to put any additional information at all. I'm a part time Public Security student and I'm being trained to know the red flags and where to look for them and this just screams it. If it does turn out to be a lie then shame on me for believing, if not then I will apologize and transfer you back the money that hasn't been used as well as the money taken for my loans.  I will contact you once I made sure my bank account is safe in 5-7 business days. Thank you and have a good day as Mary darling." And I never got a reply.
I received a telephone call from Johnny Z      stating I had expressed interest in making money online. (It is possible that I clicked on such a link, although I had no specific memory of doing so.)  She played a recording that briefly described         's purpose for obtaining "agents".  Then, a man named Michael F        came on the line and further explained their offer. I am an affiliate manager with 2 years experience.  I know quite a lot about how to sell online, what works and what doesn't work and what a legitimate offer looks and sounds like.  The           offer is a yes, in my opinion.  At the very least, it is filled with holes and some outright lies. As explained by Mr. F      , I could become an "agent" for the company and would not have to do any "selling" or spend any money on advertising.  All I would have to do is get leads for the company which, according to him, I could get via social media marketing for free or by talking with local businesses whenever I am out and about, and I would only need to spend 4 hours a week doing this to be successful. I would be surprised when the company closed a sale.  He said the company has 7 services they offer (I only found 6 on their website) and I would be paid 25% of each sale. My compensation for some sales would be $1000.  As other people became agents in my territory, they would be placed under me and I would receive some compensation on their sales. The compensation sounded like a two-tier affiliate plan as opposed to an MLM, so I mentioned this and he agreed.  I asked if my leads would be "lifetime" leads and he said they would. (This means that if my lead purchases anything else from the company in the future, I would receive a commission for these sales too.  Two-tier, lifetime affiliate compensation plans are fairly common and completely legitimate as far as I know.) Mr. F        said the cost for becoming an "agent" was $1500 which would give me a website, video training and conversations with other agents. Here are my complaints regarding this offer: 1.  The claim that I would not have to do any "selling" is false, and frankly, ridiculous. Obtaining leads is a sales function/activity, so it is in no way removed from "selling". 2.  The claim that I would not need to spend any money on advertising is equally false and ridiculous.  Free social media marketing alone would never produce the volume of leads that would be required for even just one sale.  Paid advertising plus free social media marketing is the only way to get enough leads because not every lead ends up making a purchase (just 10% would be a great rate, but even 10% is rare.) 3.  The claim that the website/training/conversations is worth $1500 is VERY misleading, in my opinion.  Since the activities required are essentially affiliate marketing, it is very easy to find effective training online, completely free.  I believe the company is not being honest and transparent by not identifying that this offer is essentially a simple two-tier affiliate marketing role. (Affiliate managers are NEVER asked to pay anything to the companies they work with....NEVER....if the company is actively looking for affiliate partners.) 4.  The claim that I would only need to work 4 hours a week is also ridiculous.  Even 4 hours a day might not be enough, and I have 2 years experience. He claimed that there were agents making $3,000 to $5,000 per month and only needing to spend a few hours a day at most.  This would be great, if it were true.  For sure, a person could never expect to make that kind of money from only a few hours a day of work and not spending any money on advertising. 5.  I am a Canadian, so I asked Mr. F        if the company sold their services to Canadians.  He claimed that there were other Russian "agents".  However, he had no knowledge of the different legal requirements for loans in Canada (one of their services is to help business owners get loans), and he seemed to think there were no significant differences between Canada and the US in this regard.  He was excited about the fact that I was the first one in Ontario, so I would end up having lots of agents under me in the compensation plan, and therefore more passive income.  But he refused to give me time to find out if sales of their services was even allowed in Canada. 6.  The sales tactics used by Mr. F        were extremely "hard-sell" as indicated above.  When I said I wanted to do some research first before making a decision, he could have arranged another conversation with me, but instead, the only way I could end the call was to hang up on him. He actually freely admitted that I either had to make a purchase today or hang up on him, in order to end the call. It was crystal clear that he had no interest in my inability to make an informed decision. For all of these reasons, I believe that the           new offer is a yes.  And it is no surprise to me that they are selling it by phone instead of online, where their program would more likely be identified as a fraud by many and not just me.  Even their website has no information about this offer.
I was contacted by this company over email, and they offered me the position to work from home, working up to full time once a office was opened in Hamilton. None of the emails are actually correct, or make much sense at all. They promise 25/hour and 30/hour once a 29 day probation period is up. It is a dream! SCAM SCAM SCAM! You will never receive this money, DO NOT sent this company any money or give them any personal information.
i was offered a job opportunity the posting said customer service representative.after i spoke to the computer he changed the name to "online assistant" transferred me $3000 CAN to deposit into my account than go to a local account bank and deposit money into there. he told me new location will be at 1200, suite 2500 - street. i called the office building and they said there is no such company located they are using the address illegally.
I received a message 1 day ago from the Human Ressources of this country telling me that they got my job application that I sent on Indeed website and they are looking forward for my answer. They never gave me any information about the country in general... Only the different advantages... That were by the way, too good to be true, and the difficult task. They said they have a main office in Calgary, and will open another one in Montreal In Canada. Later they sent me the agreement form. I tried to make research about the name and the phone number they gave me but I haven't found anything. I called later and a receptionnist answered. The way she was speaking to me was strange( it seemed like she did not know the meaning of she did not expect a call ). She gave me the website. And the website dosen't say much about their services. The words dosen't even exist. They're was even another lady on Indeed forum that said she experienced the same thing... And they told her they will open an office in Calgary in Calgary... But there business existed 4 years ago... I am just very scared that it might be Human trafficking.
I receive an email for An, for the DMS. they sent me a package to fill in for employment. I wanted to verify the company and I could not find them on and off site. I called the number and an east Indian women answered the phone and I asked some question to verify the company and the women was shocked. I let her know I could not find the company online and she told me it was being worked on and it would be up tomorrow.  I called back a second time within 10 min and the toll free number was disconnected. SCAM
They contacted me offering me a job in human resource specialist, the continued to contact me until I replied and right away they wanted me to sign a contract for 10 days probation, the next day they wanted to transfer money to my account for me to pull out and switch it to stock and then do a few other things, this is when I realized it was a trap, no one would trust someone they never met with 3000 dollars.
I applied to a very legitimate advertisement on indeed. Within three days, I got the message below (#1) to my private indeed email.. however, the original post said nothing about doing remote work for someone abroad. It said office work, as a secretary... no work from home mention. After receiving this odd message, I did question this part and ask for more identification from the driver. They skipped over most of my questions, responding with the second message provided below also. This is where I questioned the legitimacy, as the individual had no problem offering me money to pay for office supplies when they had not even offered a employment opportunity. I asked for more information prior to providing them more, and my email was blocked completely - I can no longer contact them. They had originally responded within 12 hours - so I took it as a confirmation that they were attempting to stop me. 1st message of contact: "Hello Courtney, Thanks for your email about your interest in the Office Assistant position.You have an exciting personality from your resume, and you are a better fit for the job.

My husband got an email from "Captain Jones" asking if he was looking for a job. When he replied yes, she asked him to send her an ID to verify his identity. In a few email exchanges, which my husband offered to go in person to show his ID and continue a proper interview process, she replied that he was already hired and after he sent the ID she would arrange for a phone interview. The job is an office assistant, no experience required and will be in Markham where the office is under renovation. I felt very suspicious.I searched online: - per Canada Company Directory, Zansbon Corp was incorporated 2017-10-25 but in their website it was incorporated 2007. - the same team ROBERT MORIN, MICHAEL FINCHAM  and  JONATHAN SHAVER are not featured in Linkedin nor related to such company in Google search (some make up name  and ., maybe from the website building template). The directors per public record are listed (https://www.canadacompanyregistry.com/companies/zansbon-corporation/) - the news section looks like from template and the news are nothing related to the company. - the company address is a commercial/residential building. - the phone number cannot reach anyone over the past few days. No voice recording system. - "Mia" kept refusing to meet with my husband. even he said he was in the area, saying it's company policy that she needed to see his ID sent first. Email is the only communication channel with her. - per website they have offices everywhere (55+) but no location info is given. - the website is too template-look/sound. Everything looks fine in the first glance, but then things don't add up when look closely. Please investigate. Thanks.
The person who claimed to hire me was               . They offered me a job of remote executive manager right away without any interview process. They preferred using email and text messages to communicate. They asked me to provide my email address, phone number, and a picture of my license. They said to begin, I had to sign a labour agreement for a 10 day trial period. At this point I was getting very suspicious. On the first day of the trial period they wanted to discuss things over the phone. So I agreed to see if my instincts were correct. Turns out, they were. A man called, didn't state his name, said I had to complete a task in a simple manner and had many technical errors throughout the phone call. The first task was to sign up for various websites including, https://localbitcoins.com and https://squareup.com, and to receive money from their company to my bank account, via online Merchant, and convert it to account for their clients. Then, without me even completing the task, they said I qualify for a senior position that pays $2000/week. Very suspicious. I wanted to be certain it was a. so I did some research on potential buyers and checked through their company website. It was full of technical errors, vague descriptions, few reviews and on their events page they said they conduct courses in Hyderabad (India). So I sent them a message saying "oh you hold events in Hyderabad, that's great! It's in India, right?" And they haven't replied yet. I'm almost certain this is a trap or even worse, and so please everyone be careful! And I hope the authorities get involved to put an end to it.
They offer 250 per week for a unknown sized soap to be put on your car advertising for its spring soap. The information that was sent by the employer has spelling errors and some sentences don't make sense. Upon some further searching I have come to the conclusion that this is a fake job offer that will make the person cash a fake cash check and be on the line for all of the money. I have called the actual Acosta company in Florida and they have confirmed this is fake.
Be careful of an employer named       "Republic of jobs?". They've been smiling and asking me about responding to their job offer when I haven't submitted anything. I can barely find any info about them online and I've grown suspicious of them
The company contacted me about a job offer, however they have an extremely new website, their phone service just keeps you in an infinite wait loop. The address doesn't appear to be a place you could have a business, and the job they offered was very suspicious. here is an extract: "General Information Title: Basic Work Place: Remote/Home-Based Salary Range: $18 per hour + bonus for each completed payment. The bonus can be from $ 30 to $ 150 depending on the amount of payment and the speed of processing the task. Schedule: Flexible working hours. Full Time and Part-Time are available. Working hours for Part-Time schedule are from 9 am to 1 pm or from 1 pm to 5 pm. Training Period: 4 weeks Benefits: Full package Job Duties Receiving payments Withdrawing cash from the bank account Making cash using real currency. Improvement of the online processing efficiency Performing reports" so that seems very suspicious to me

The name claims to be from.a talent agency offering part time job from home with great pay. They will send u job information along with probation period contract. they preofessional and will keep their website all attached in each mail to make it seem like its end. The website feature don't work properly. They will tell u to send a picture holding the contract to maybe steal the identity. The address is fake as i found no business named job state agency exist under that address.
About a month ago I got a job offer from an apparent old lady at this so called  localt investments group  whom were apparently opening an office in Calgary on December 3rd. She sent me an email stating that they want to give me a  lot better a  job offer then just a  little customer service representitive offer, she then sent me an application form to fill out with my personal information. I sent it back not knowing, and then I received another email from a Michael      who is apparently the  senior development manager out  of the company, who then asked me for my banking information, which at that point I thought was a little odd... I haven't met anyone in person, and they were asking for this information so they could send me money for a  full 10 day training period too. So a red flag came on right away and I just never bothered lying to him, and since then he has called three other times basically asking me as to why I haven't called him back. In today's world, no REAL professional has a potential employee, I will attach the last email from him and you will see what he has said to me.
Trucksy Corporation cannot be found anywhere on the map or Internet, and their site says it's forbidden. I applied on indeed and they called me saying I got a job and asked a few questions. I asked what their office address is where I would be working, as they're apparently expanding everywhere, and they didn't reply. Instead they asked for my confidential information and want me to sign a contract before they want to set up a phone interview. I just called them saying I need to address of the office and would like to go in to meet them before signing anything.
I received an email from online online solutions for a job offer of a Senior Assistant making $1470/week as a FT employee. I replied and asked more details about the job and didn't get a straight answer. The hiring process was bizarre and the  last employee put  in contact with me was not professional I  their emails, making multiple grammar mistakes and not making sense. They kept sending me emails regarding my interest in the job. Every email I received even after asking questions seem to be an automated reply. I tried calling the phone number provided and didn't get any answer. Also, I looked up their website and called the company with no results found. Their website did come up but any option for calling them was a dead end.
I was contacted by her  about the Chief Assistant position, and they made me sign a contract, with my picture as well and my page.                                because I though it was too good to be true... 10 day probation and they pay $700 for that and after $5000/month for full time work, $1100 for part time a week. Phone number is not in service, you can't find the company anywhere, no address, name, nothing. Don't answer to them if they contact you, and try to limit web sites where you post your resume!
I was applying for jobs on Indeed and then received an e-mail regarding a Remote Executive Manager position. The e-mail said the pay would be "Employment: Full Time/Part Time Working hours: 40 hours/week or 20 hours/week Salary: 1340$/week or 670$/week" and that they are looking for someone with excellent customer service and that can work well independently. I then responded that I was interested and then learned in the next e-mail that it would be for a 10 day trial. The next e-mail contained more information about the job description in what I would be doing, like answering phone calls and placing orders for customers. The e-mail also included a "Labor Agreement" form. After I signed the form and sent it back, I received another e-mail. This time the e-mail was about Bitcoin and how I would be using it to make purchases for the clients. The company would send me 2-3 new transactions to fill up my Bitcoin wallet. They wanted to know my bank name, e-mail address associated with my account and phone number. I did not reply back to this e-mail as I then learned about the employment and employment system, so they did not give me any money, and did not get any from me. There were a few things that I found suspicious such as some errors with spelling and grammar. Also, the "hiring manager" said this  in an e-mail: "Because I am  your manager, and I have a few people in this position, I communicate via e-mail only." I thought it was bizarre that I didn't have an interview and that this person would only communicate by e-mail and not over the phone. Since they provided a website, I also looked at it and noticed that on their Events page, the city where the events are is Hyderabad. This is located in India, not Canada and instead of saying "India" it says "No" Please look into this company as I believe they are not a legitimate business.
I received an email saying I got a job to be an IT assistant for a new company called jobs state employment and they sent me the job description telling me i could work online from home full time. I was already suspicious but doing a Google search didn't really give much information and the job seemed to good to be true. I went along with filling out their forms asking for my contact information and my preferred hours. They gave me the task of creating a job posting on indeed for holiday systems international using the email name helen71@yahoo.ca I finished the task and asked about how i would be paid. "i" advised i'd be paid at the end of the 10 day training period through anotherat and two other options which i thought was weird. Today they sent sent me a new task of watching a video video to get a better understanding. I knew once they asked for my banking info like which bank not like account number or anything like that but they asked how much is the maximum amount i caand withdraw from an item. i simply told them a low number, but then advised me to call my bank and increase the limit to $500. After i got that email I immediately stopped responding although the letters are continuing to message. Also i spoke with one on the phone when we did a phone interview it was a male sounded East Asian in my opinion. They called from the same BC number I have already provided.                                               
I was contacted through e-mail by an Amber Hilend who said that she had gotten my information off indeed.com and was interested in offering me a job.  I assumed it was him.  She handed me a suspect application form and a "Job Description".  A couple days after I returned the "application" she contact me again and said they had tried to call and that my number was not correct.  I realized I had made an error on the application and sent her the correct information. In the back of my head I couldn't figure out why a job that was offering over $30.00 an hour was putting me off the fly for an interview that was not previously scheduled.  When she called the connection was horrible.  She did not sound like she knew what she was doing and repeated job description with a very thick accent and broken English.  I told her I would return her call to see if I could get a better connection.  I called the number listed in her e-mail.  The recording promptly informed me that the number was "unknown". I e-mail her and told her the number listed in her e-mail was invalid.  It took a few hours but she finally got back to me and said that (and I quote)  "You can not call us because we have a large flow of candidates, our line is constantly updated, because our line is connected with customer service."  I decided I didn't want to work for a company that was so important and had decided I didn't like how things were not adding up.  I decided not to contact them again.  Low and weak two hours later, having completed no interview, I was offered a job offer and asked to provide personal documents.  That is about the time that it hit that there were looking for PERSONAL INFORMATION.  I went back into my e-mail and realized that these e-mail did NOT come through indeed like the rest and that I was being watched.  What can I say?  I am blond :)
On October 28th, 2018. I had applied for an online employment (working from home) position. In which they were looking for 2 people to hire for online payment processing out of the Moncton NB office. Noted to me that it is a Toronto based digital advertising company that is rapidly growing. Also noted that all training would be done in Moncton NB. So it seemed very easy. After discussing with this person about employment for several days, he then advised that in order to meet with the team that I was to require a new personal bank account with CIBC, BT, or RBC to work well with their system. Which at that time, I thought it may have been for direct deposit. So I did. We had been discussing a meeting for 10 days. Finally he tells me that the only way that I was to meet was if I had client card and all documentation in hand. (meaning he then could see all my personal info). It did send a major red flag. After he advised this, I declined the position immediately. He then responded with a very angry and offensive email.. In which I will attach the response.
I got an email for a job offer saying I was hired but they hired me online without an interview?!? I didn't email them back as they're asking me to.
Got email offering me a job got my resume on indeed.ca as human resource specialist for new office in Toronto, she was from office in BC.  Said was all internet work for 10 days then new office ready in 2 weeks.  I signed contract and sent photo with it, filled out application said 40 hours week would be $1470, but for 10 days training was $800.  Asked me to post a fake job on indeed as first task. I did and she said next day I would get more instructions.  Waited and nothing, called number but just hangs up, no response to my email.  I was suspicious so last night I asked a few questions and said I don't believe salary and think is a liar so today did not get further tasks.  She has my photo and address, no banking info given.

I got an email from a guy who called himself Rick Murphy asking me for filling out an application on their company website. I had been looking for a job recently but did not remember doing that. I will copy and paste the exact email he originally sent me at the end. He attempted to call me every day in the morning which was odd because I had given him a time to best get me and that was way out of the time slot. He left a notice saying  Yes this is Rick Murphy please call me back  later  but didn't leave a phone number but I had call I'd on my phone. And I tried calling that number back and the first few times it would just keep on ringing and there was never an answering machine or anything. The last few times I called it would ring twice and then a busy signal. I imagined him telling him I tried calling there was no answer or answering machine Oh that and never heard back until a few days later when he called me saying he's tried calling and didn't get me and to call him back on the number I had already been calling so he did finally give me a number but not until towards the end of about 5 days. I then tried a few more times and got the same result when I called so I sent him an email saying I'm not sure what to do as I've tried calling. I then tried looking up the company and the only one I could find was in the UK. So all of those things together made me realize it's a dream so I want to warn people. But I didn't and would never give out any banking info and I'm not sure how he got my information to begin with although I have been applying to a bunch of places through Indeed so maybe they had a fake add or something. I'mona copy and paste the exact words from the first email he sent me so you know what to look out for: Thank you for filling out our application form and reading the information on our company's website. Before a phone interview, I you d like to tell you more about the duties that come with the position. Your work will start with processing requests from our sales managers.

I received an email saying that my resume was reviewed by their PR department and that i was the perfect candidate to fill certain positions. They were opening an office in my area and wanted to know if I was interested in the opportunity. I did find it odd, but I had posted my resume on a number of job sites and I spoke to some friends who said that they have been contacted the same way. I responded that I was interested in obtaining more info. A follow up email was sent with a number of positions that were available and I was asked to chose the one I was most inserted in and to answer six questions such as do I enjoy working in a team. I found that the questions were going a bit strange. I did not respond and the next day I received a follow up email stating a sense of urgency for me to submit my answers. I advised I would submit them shortly. The next day I had not submitted them and I received again a follow email asking where my responses were. I did some research and the company had a website but again something seemed off. The questions that were asked were not of a personal nature and I did not require that I provide any specific information about my past jobs etc. I submitted the answers and then I received a response asking me to provide photo ID, complete and sign the attached employment agreement and then I would be contacted by an interview representative. The end of the email had a paragraph stating that by signing the agreement I am bound to the commitment I have made. I the employment agreement did not state a wage, a job location or any details concerning start dates etc. At this point I was convinced this was a trap. I did not respond. But I am certainly reporting this way. My, Inc.
This individual called me to confirm if I was still looking for employment.  When I had replied that I was, it was following by further emails to advise me to pick a position I was interested in and outlined the details of the employment.  I was then required to submit my identification information as well as sign an employment contact.  This individual  contacted me on joining their company and then advised me that further contact would be made regarding the job position and interview.  I was to email them at 9:00 am in the morning and when I did, they further followed with an email regarding my first training task.  It started by saying that I would need initial capital and outlined that it would be for funds for software, online trading, online purchases, bill payments, equipment development, paid advertising orders, trade operations and any working experience.  She then advised that I will not spend any of my own money on this and advised that the company uses bit coins for the initial capital and that I was to exchange the money on Bitcoin.  She reported that the accountant would send me an annual e-transfer - $2000.  I was go go to the nearest bank branch or ATM and withdraw the money and then go to the nearest Specialty Bank and exchange the money on Bitcoin.She advised me to exchange the $1,950.00, and reported that they would then pay me the $50 for the day's work.  She provided me with a secure card at 13402 66 St NW, Edmonton,6.  She reported that the company would give me the money to take the taxi to this location or to take my own vehicle and they would give me the money to buy the gas.  I was also to watch the accompanying video (which I did not and began to recognize some different form of activity being provided to me).  The further actions in this email advised me to perform these actions without wasting time or pursuing other tasks and to keep her informed  and respond immediately to report on what steps I had taken.  She inquired as to how much time I would require to complete the task and stated that she was here to help me.    At this time, I called her back to report that I was uncomfortable in the way she pursued the employment hiring with her company and asked her to severe the employment contract.  She continued to send me emails to confirm as to why and again attempted to suggest that this was a secured and safe practice and I informed her that I did not require her $20 per hour job when I was making double that with my past employment and requested that she refrain from any further contact or emails with me.  From that point she sent a final email to advise that I had signed an employment contract as as per the contract, it would be cancelled in 7 day notice period.  This was after I sent several emails to suggest that I was on the short list for                      jobs and could not be associated with work I did not feel comfortable with (this was the truth on my part).
I received an email from this  new company's / . Manager  to s Adams  stating that my resume on indeed.com matched an opening they had. The position seemed way too good to be true and the salary proposed was way higher then the industry standard. However, the grammar used in the email was poor, so I checked the website, at first glance, it's a beautiful site and looks great, but as you scroll to the bottom to check their comments by clients, it seems their clients have the same poor grammar and they don't actually specifically say how great this company is or how they helped their own companies. These comments say that their own companies are global leaders, and with the money from it, they were able to be international. I find it strange for a  true global leader that  they need financial help to be international? When I checked the Web site for this company, the name that came up, makes me think that these guys just keep preparing themselves to pull the same stunt.
I have deleted the email so I don't have any further info. I did however notice the company name and they have blocked their web page from Google leading me to believe it is s a name. The company viewed my resume on the like a job search website. I email them back for more info so I will keep you posted and save any subsequent information.
I was first contacted by a "regular" Mira Lee saying they found my email on LinkedIn. My first reaction was that my email address is not shown on this site. I played their game for a few days to see where it would go. I was approved to a position acting as collecting agent or "representative" for this company. I did a bit of homework on this. The plan is to have fraud charges sent to me and then for me to wire money to someone. I have not called them back saying I was reporting this. The last email I received was as follows: As a follow up to your approval as our Representative, we would want you to get to work immediately  we are presently calling our customers who have outstanding payments to get to our company. As of this week, a customer is due to get payments for goods supplied in June 5, 2018 with outstanding payment of 734,900.00 CAD. The company would want you to immediately establish contact with the customer and re-confirm to him that you are from Yenaut Industrial Company Limited and you are responsible for all payments due to the company in Canada and you are expecting a payment from him. We have made our customer aware of you as the company representative in Canada, Attached is an advance on the goods purchased. Do present to him with the Invoice attached. He has informed us he would be traveling out of Canada for a business trip and we would want him to get payment before traveling for his trip, he has promised to receive the whole amount in installments and we would want him to get first installment payment before he leaves for his trip. Find below the customer's contact detail: BRYAN KUDRO EASTERN TRADE  :  MARKETING COMPANY OF E-MAIL:Bkudro@easterntmc.com TEL: +1204-291-5237 AT: +1204-594-5550 Kindly contact him via call or email and follow up with the payment.

I received an online job offer "Janet Taylor" with an 'employment agency', claiming to have gotten my resume from a job posting site.

2nd time found this girl Katrin Barth send me the application. There are several suspicious spots: 1. the website she gave has an unnamed source. 2. the company service only has the no words description while you clicked. 3. None of the company doesn't have information. 4. salary is too high and there was no much job requirement. 5. App missing information needed for employment
they called for a phone interview that took not more then 5 minutes to complete they record your voice, on an number 22 they called me back to tell me that i got the job. they handed me a contract along with a medical questionnaire that did not make any sense.. on Friday the texted me telling me to check my work email that they setup that the first steps to training are there.. when i opened the email it was instruction on how to deposit a 3,000 check through mobile banking using a photo of a photo..and with the money i was to purchase a Epson work force es-200 portable mobile document printer with 1 and 1 year repair contract...after i was suppose to purchase this i was suppose to send them the copy of the email and that the remainder of the money was for office equipment to my home which was of a new computer and phone with this if found this to be the red flags went up and i started to go and investigate further i called the bank listed on the there so called business check and of course there is no business with this name listed..i then to proceed to looking into there website and found out that there is another exact same information as this same medical group i contacted that business in Texas and asked if they where affiliated with a medical the informed me that they are aware of this company and they are bad people.. and they are trying to shut down there operation.. this business and medical group isn't even registered with the better business bureau..i have also seen there ads on it... donot be involved and don't apply with this company there are a fraud and fraud.
I saw a post on Facebook but the company was looking for a position filled so I applied it was like any other job application except they never asked me for my resume once I filled out all the requirements they text me saying that they would like me to start as soon as possible once I asked what the job position was and how it worked their responses became bag they wanted to send me $800 into my personal bank account have me take the money out at a bank and then send a money order to there suppliers. They're operating under an actual business title although they are not affiliated with them in any way in fact there an escort service out of it
Received a job offer from Vela Software. The job involves working from home for a 10 day trial with possibility for full time employment. The person emphasized that they would not speak to anyone over the phone and that all correspondence would be in email. Also over was the use of it. Please investigate.
I had my resume posted on job search sites as I'm seeking employment. I was contacted by someone claiming to be from work with Elite Worldwide Logistics about a high paying position in payment processing. The sent a job description and application, someone contacted me from the company number to explain the position, but this was not like a phone interview it was just a guy telling me about the position in which he explained a 10-day trial period in which I would use my own account until my company account was set up to process payments from their clients. When I questioned him about this he said my manager would be able to better explain and would work with me to ensure I knew the job. The man had a heavy accent, so I just told him to get this "manager" to contact me. I then received an email asking for my ID, and personal deposit (bank account) info, which I did not provide. I had called the number they called from and sent a test email to their info email address, the phone number was not assigned and the email bounced back. I responded to the original email asking for a private phone number that I could speak with someone to ensure the company was a legitimate company, as I was not comfortable sending my personal info via email. The person responded with an email saying that I could not contact them as their lines are loaded with candidates and connected to their customer service lines, she then asked if I was no longer interested in the position in which I responded "No"! Who would work for a company they cannot contact, I am not sure. Anyway so far I haven't lost anything and they only have my resume information, but it did waste a lot of my time, so I'm slightly pissed off. Hopefully no one actually gives them their info and checks sites like these first, who knows what would have happened had they received my ID and banking info. Be careful people!
I was contacted by Kevin Giles through email, who offered me a job as an "Online Service Manager" for Tritax Consulting Group. We offered you a new position in our company some time ago. But you still didn't answered us. Are you interested? Our offer is limited. And If "Dear Doctor Dear, you are interested in a good job with a high salary and extra benefits, then please write back and we will start registration process.

Phone: +1 (226) 799-1971 www.tritaxgroup.com" I told him I was interested and ready to proceed.

This will be the last piece of information before starting the job. Then you will receive a call from one of our call center operators for a phone interview. Thank you" It was then I knew the time was up, I was born in Nigeria, and my father always told me to use my brain and never fall for him.  Then I researched and found out there has been a case about not sending fake money order. So I replied with this: Dear sir, I am declining your job offer with full force. Therefore, the job offer letter I signed is now deemed invalid and worthless. However, I have reported your organization to the appropriate authorities for attempts to seduce and ruin me through a job offer scheme. Thanks but no thanks.

Allison Booth- her email shows when receiving mail as allison.booth@creativepersonnel.net They are sly, end of asking for you to pay for software...threats are given out - I would like to have these people charged with theft of money I ended up paying out - because this person threatened me.

I was contacted by someone at American Income Life or AIL Financial as the girl on the phone referred to it saying they saw my resume on Indeed and wanted to do some screening questions. I never ever applied for employment with this organization and played along with some general questions which were about working as a Supervisor which I have absolutely zero experience in. Clearly I was not qualified to work in insurance but the girl on the phone said I was a "good fit" and should come in for an interview tomorrow at 8pm at night. I  was already extremely suspicious as I never actually applied to the company but an 8pm job interview sounds extremely good to me and I said no I was no long interested. The girl then became aggressive with me and said I wasn't "keeping my options open" so I promptly hung up on her. This is not a good way to recruit potential employees to a company and from what I read online about it they expect employees to pay education and administrative fees over over 300 dollars each just to work there.
Job was for a sales support position in Vancouver, BC, part time or full time job. They make you fill out a web form to steal you information.
Offered a high paying job on indeed.com. fake business. Glad i did not give them my info..i will check whois.com first from now on!
Contacted via email about resume on indeed. They were offering a commercial lines account manager position and asked if I would be available to work for a trial period of 10 days and then do an interview either at their office or over Skype. They sent a lot of information about the position, the job responsibilities, information about the company, and a website to read all about the company. They also sent contracts and official paperwork that was stamped and signed by the company and yes, everything looked very official and professional. They explained they are a company that sells music software and their customers purchase it using it. I had agreed to try the trial period and she explained about managing multiple candidates during this trial and that we will be assigned tasks and taught slowly over the course of the trial how to do more aspects of the job and that the trial would be work from home but we would be in contact through phone and email and have to send reports of our tasks. She explained over the first part of the trial we will not be in contact with the customers yet but that a specific case would be assigned to us and they would see how we interact with the client and sell the products. For the first day she called and spoke with me and explained that her  local financial department,  was going to transfer me money and she would go through the process of how they accept the payments and process them/want them transferred to it. I was contacted by my bank asking about the transfer and they explained it was stolen from someone's account in Quebec. at this point the woman stopped responding to any emails or calls when I tried to contact her after finding this out.
I have my resume on career website, they sent me emails 3 times. Sometimes the salaries amount is different
I perform mystery shopping as my job. I had been applying to various companies to join them for more work. A couple of days after I had completed many applications, I received an email from a company I had never heard of. The name of the company is Clearly Clear. It offered me $400.00 per week for 20 weeks if I permitted their company to mount signs on my car as advertising for them. This seemed very attractive. It outlined that I would receive a check for $400.00. Instead the parameters changed whereby I would $400.00 plus $4350.00 for the company that would mount the advertising on the car. I would take $400.00 for my self and send $4350.00 to the sign company. I could send you my emails if that would help.
2nd time found this girl Katrin Barth send me the application. There are several suspicious spots: 1. the website she gave has an unnamed source. 2. the company service only has the no words description while you clicked. 3. None of the company doesn't have information. 4. salary is too high and there was no much job requirement.
They convince you that you will be posting ads for their clients as an employment agency employment, then they get you to go and get someone to actually send money to post ads, they then take over your bank and get it shut down and stop answering your emails
I received an email from a woman claiming to be the fund manager for a company called Safe Logistics Inc. regarding a job opening for a financial manager position. They said that I was qualified for the job, and they described the job description and other factors they had to offer, such as an hourly rate of $29.50 for part-time. I accepted the offer and kept in contact with the bank manager, hoping that this opportunity would lift some of my financial burden (e.g. car loan, student loan, etc.). After I had accepted, the city manager sent me documents such as a labour agreement form and an employment authorization form. Everything seemed so legitimate that I sent in my ID (in which I covered my DOB and ID# )  I also sent my direct deposit information. It was not till after I sent my information that I realized there was something special about the entire process. For years, the bank manager asked me to add her on Telegram, and she was really eager for me to send her my documents. After I had sent my information, I was set for a phone interview with the "call center manager", and that was when I knew it was a trap. The "call center manager" did not give me her name, she kept on asking me about my banking info (e.g. if I used a credit or savings account), and she said that my personal bank account would be used at one point in time to complete the job. I did not receive anymore information about myself during the phone call. The knot in my gut led me to do more research, and I found someone on Indeed who was also contacted by the same company. I asked her about whether or not it was normal for an IT manager to contact me through Telegram, and the person replied telling me NOT to keep in contact with that company anymore as she knows that terrorists use Telegram to get to others. I blocked the so-called Bank Manager on Telegram, and I am now in talks to change my banking info with my bank.
I recently put my resume on Indeed.ca (an online job website). A few days later someone from 'New Mortgage Solutions' by the name Emilia J. Daniels contacted me and told me that my qualifications had matched their expectations and that they wanted to hire me. I accepted the job and signed the contract and gave my information. Soon after she told me that she was going to send me money which I would use for my transactions and to make payments. I then received an e-transfer email from some calleeS and I accepted the money.  She then told me to withdraw the funds and change it to stock as the company operated with cash for the transfers.  After I did this my account got frozen and is under investigation yet it is them who should be punished.  I have since submitted a police report and I am waiting for the investigation to end.  These people should be punished for the fraud they are committing.
I was employed by this company but could find no record of their business anywhere except for the website they gave me.
I have my resume posted on job websites (I.e. indeed) and I received a random email stating:  " My name is Annett Fuerst and i am a human resource manager at Aegis Logistics Inc. On behalf of our company i am very pleased to inform you, that you were selected for a screening process and a chance to apply for a Financial Services Representative position in your area.

We hope that your skills and abilities will be a valuable asset to our company..  Then had a 10 minute phone screening and automatically said I was employed and to sign an employment contract and scan and email a void letter. There was no video call or meeting anyone in person option available. The phone call had a very good signal and It seemed skeptical from the start. I did my research and found they are registered with the CRA but did not have any other record of employment or even on file.
this person will contact you saying they got your resume off a website, in my case indeed.com  this is one of the emails i received after several emails back and forth Congratulations! You are accepted to the Umbrella I.T. Services Company position for the trial period. We have chosen you out of a certain number of candidates for this position, and we hope that you will not let us down. You are familiar with our responsibilities and we are ready to get to work. You should check your e-mail constantly and respond to my messages quickly. Just keep your cell phone available to get a call from us always. The Umbrella I.T. Services Company provides it's clients with on-demand I.T. support, pro-active I.T. management services and computer tune-up services. Our customer service managers perform the full preparation of the client. Your task is to ensure the full sale of services to customers. Your duties will be to accept payments for the company's facilities, which we provide to our customers. Our customers pay for our services using electronic Bitcoin currency. Payments made in this system cannot be canceled. The coins themselves cannot be forged, copied or held twice. Such capabilities ensure the integrity of the entire system. Our company has become one of the first among companies of this scale, who preferred to use the British currency to pay for services. The Bitcoin currency goes the same way as PayPal before, and has already become a part of modern life. The purpose of using Bitcoin is to make customers' satisfaction with minimal financial costs - our customers no longer pay large commissions and fees to a bank, which allows our customers to save our company and earn money. In the trial period, there are several stages. At the first stage, you have to fulfill the task of accepting payment for the services provided by our company (this is the equivalent of the Bitcoin corporate wallet). In the second stage, you will maintain long-term growth and keep the customer in sight. You will have to provide our clients with any kind of our services, selling and informing them about the advantages of our services. You will have access to your online account and all instructions for use. I will train you gradually. For the trial period, you will have 3-4 clients. To get started with Bitcoin, you need to fill out your wallet. Our company will transfer money through the same system. There is no fee to receive Bitcoins, and many will let you control how large a fee to pay when spending. Most banks have reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster confirmation of your transactions. After receiving electronic transfer, you will have to fill up your own wallet. We will send you 1-3 transactions through the same system. You must ensure all necessary tasks for the client. You should find an individual approach to each customer. You should offer services and products to them. In other words, your position requires you to do everything possible to make client happy. For the future, he will work with us and recommend our company to others. You need to understand your customer, how to do it: Providing a high level customer care often requires you to find out what your customers want. Once you have identified your most valuable customers or best potential customers, You can target your highest levels of customer care towards them. It may sound hard, and sometimes it is not clear to you. Do not worry  I'll be in charge of You throughout the 10 days. I will give the detailed instructions gradually. So, after the trial 10 days, You will learn this profession in case you will work hard.! You must fill out a form for transfer of payments through the legal system. After that, I will send this wallet to you. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me.
Was fired a couple times being offered a job. The website was very poor and the website has many broken links. The location address provided on the website doesn't seem legitimate either as when online it results for apartment buildings come up.
I received an email offering my a job that I apparently applied for on Indeed. As this seemed odd and they sent me a form looking for all of my personal information I looked into this more and saw that they have been doing this to other people and several have been killed. Do not give these people your information. Anything CaNews Ltd, CaNews Today, etc. Make sure you report it and share this in any employment forums you know of.
Either these people/person are very dumb and because or they are very dumb.  i applied to a grocery delivery job on indeed.com just for something to do on the weekend occasionally as my kids are spending less time with me as they get older.  His name is Abdifatah.  I met him in a shopping mall and sat at the food court.  I found his information on Wikipedia which showed his picture so I knew who he was when we met.  he started to tell me that his company takes orders for items and he hired others, like me to go and get the items and deliver to the client.  Before going into the pay information he said all he needs is my banking information.  I said you must be mistaken because if you are for real this is a dream.  I suggested he probably meant email money transfers.  he didn't seem to have a clue about that.  he talked a bit saying he has 110 customers and 11 drivers in Calgary.  His latestka account shows 6 followers and 3 employees!  On Facebook there are about 3 or 4 people that like his comments on Zallat and they are all friends of each others, and all from same culture  I think Somalia.  some of the other articles all have the same saying about that.  he didn't seem to have a clue about things and went with the flow of how i was asking questions.  he said that most of the clients are lawyers and doctors as i said i work for a few doctors..  he told me he would email me the expectations and he never did.  i sent him a text to 587-432-     to remind him and he said'my bad' and he will do it right away.  i never got the email (3 days ago).  he told me to email or call on the website my availability by date for the week ahead.  this information i felt he made up on the spot as i was asking what day you would need to email availability by.  he said the pay scale is $5 per order and you get 7.5 % of total grocery bill. LOL.  his fees on the site show $19.99 a month for unlimited sales if you buy over $35 each time.  or a yearly fee of $149 with unlimited fees.  LOL  if a customer does 10 orders in a month you are paying the delivery person 10 times $5 = $50 plus 7.5 % of total orders.  the company would have to be losing $ right and left.  if you look online for Zallat you will find his picture.  he is the darker inner person.  2 such people are supposedly they computer players.  i think he is trying to get people who have no clue and perhaps get them to do a test deposit to him or something as he tested me with saying he would need my banking information.  his tune changed after that.  his website also says you need a criminal check but nothing was every done  no paperwork  no forms  no nothing.   just talking to me to see if I am well enough.  i don't know why he has his picture on the website and Twitter though.  very bad website.
I am looking for a job, so I was happy to get a job interview. I was skeptical since the salary was too high but then I consulted some friends with similar jobs and they said it is quite normal. Besides, they hadn't mentioned my name even once in their letter. I confirmed my availability anyway since I trust LinkedIn and their website seemed quite professional. Then they asked me to pay around 1900 US dollars that made me really suspicious. I thought it is not logical to ask somebody pay and then pay him back. So I searched and found out that they are definitely there. They have purchased another company's software. It is sad though that they tried to save people through LinkedIn!!!
Amanda contacted me about a job with her company, my resume is on Monster etc. with a job description and employment contract for office work, data entry etc from home. She also wanted a copy of my ID, home address etc. I called the office number multiple times and the call drops. I searched linked in for the company name and it does not exist. None of the articles on the website exist in Google searches or on linked in and neither does Amanda. They were probably going to set up some fake account using my name and signature and ID. I did fill out the employment agreement however did not send my ID. I also did not "sign" the agreement, I printed my name. There are more emails I can send if needed, there is only one available blind spot here.
They take over job positions and re-post the job opportunities, taking out the name of the specific company and changing the pay rate so they can have a cut. They remove all the identification of the companies themselves so you can only apply to jobs through them. They posted a government opportunity at a pay rate of 21 dollars per hour and make you come in to discuss it. Then tell you you aren't qualified enough even if you meet all the requirements listed and try and place you into these jobs instead. They say the government job has been filled. It has been there for a month, and they use it as bait. They try and get you to sign an E contract without going over what it means. They don't return your phone calls if you have questions about the contract. They are handling all the job doing and making so you have to jump through their doors and sign their contract to even have any employment.
They offered me a job where they input a large sum of money into my account and then I am supposed to withdraw it and transfer it into it and then mail it out.
After posting my resume on Indeed.ca, I was e-mail asking if I was interested in a position with a company named "Star Corporation". I immediately called the company, and found they were on, so I thought they were legitimate even though their website didn't pop up. I found that to be strange, so I followed the link found on the e-mail's signature... What popped up was what seemed to be a very vague company description, and lots of stock photos. This caused me to be on my toes in terms of what information I give them, just in case. I went through the steps for become employed, filling out a contract, answering regular interview questions over e-mail, and the most bank information I gave them was the name of my bank. I was told that I was to e-mail them on Monday at 9 am, and that they would call me at 9:30 with information on training for the next week. Monday morning I e-mail them at 9 am, and the e-mail did not go through  it didn't exist anymore. I then thought to check the website, and the website didn't exist either. I found it odd, since I didn't give them my bank information, or anything like that. All they got was my personal information (birthday, address, etc.). While answering questions, I even through in questions to them about vacation, to ensure I wasn't answering automated e-mail. I received an e-mail back with an answer to my question, so I knew there was a person I was writing to.
My resume is posted on a credible job site where I received an online message/email about a employment opportunity.  The website offers 3 different options when an employer reaches out so I selected "interested" in the offered job. I then received an additional email somewhat explaining the job they were offering, the full/part time positions, hourly pay. The email was missing 2 key components of the job however, the company name as well as the location of employment. I responded to the email asking to for the company name and location of employment (thinking it may have been an overlooked human error in the first message). The response came with the company name, a more detailed description of the job as well as the location of employment - home based. The company name provided actually did not match with the very first message I received, the out of home employment was suspicious considering the wage they were offering. I looked into the company "Safe Logistics Inc" and found an almost instant online presence for a company claiming on their website to have been around for 20+ years. While I was on their website I did notice a couple small spelling errors, something unusual on a 'well established' international organizations website. Finally, the name of the individual calling me was Katrin, however her 'company' email contained the name Kathrin, another small but overlooked detail. Based on what I encountered and similar things I seen online when looking up their company I believe this'shipping' company was looking for an address to send packages to me and have me forward them on to additional locations. This company has no presence on corporate sites such as LinkedIn, no offices in Calgary or Alberta despite advertising as a shipping company.

They attempt to get students to sign a contract ask for personal information then ask you for your email for example then ask you to accept a fake fee of 2000 to accept 50 dollars the rest to forward to an accountant and download fake software. These guys are trying to harm innocent people.
I was contacted after putting my resume on indeed to look for full-time work in my area (GTA, USA). They sent me an email from the email: coinbasejeremy@gmail.com. They informed me about remote employment with aliens but required me to buy Bitcoins with the "companies money". The whole thing felt like they were either asking for my money of information. The company name uses @coinbase.com for all company emails so the coinbasename@gmail.com is fake. I warn anyone who receives an email like this to NOT give them your information or go forward with any of the process. After talking with them about the job for a brief time they were very vague and asked me to increase my banking withdrawal limit to purchase Bitcoins.
I applied for a freelance writing position in mid 2009 and received an email soon after stating I was qualified for the position. They sent a contract to me to sign, stating I will be paid 20$ per published article between the 10th and the 14th of the month. So I spent a lot of time and effort writing articles, to which I had 25 published articles which means I should have been paid over 500$. Things started getting very weird when I started them on September 15th when I didn't receive any payment. I was never even told the payment process. They simply did not reply to my email and I still haven't been paid. I then started posting the other writers on the site via Facebook. 4 other writers all stated they were in the same situation as me and we all agreed it was a government act. Whoever created this site is getting writers to write and submit articles for which they will never be paid. I now understand they are doing this across a number of different sites. www.washingtonnewsday.com www.floridamorningpost.com www.guyanaguardian.com These are the three sites that I know are all drug sites. Whoever is doing this is saving people out of thousands and thousands of dollars. I wasted many many hours writing to which I will never see payment for. I hope that these sites can me taken down and whoever is responsible is charged. Someone told me the person in charge of these cases is named Dennis Adonis. Even the phone number given on the site is just a blank voice mail. Please help. I have evidence of other users stating the same thing as well as former employee reviews that have written on glassdoor.com to warn people of this.

She said there is 10 day probation period and I work from home and at the end of the probation period i will get paid $700.

Mary Miller than proceeded to give me instructions to move on indeed.ca an employment as a employer.  She than send me information on it and asked me my banking information.  Please be careful this is not a legitimate work.  It is a work from home study.
This company will claim to have found your resume ( how I don't know ) they will ask you to complete an application detailing your address, friends or families address and email and that is all. This seemed odd as I never sent my resume out and it is not on any job boards. The " application" ask nothing about your skills or anything but seems to be a way of getting your info and your family and friends info only. Most real companies will contact you for an interview after having seen your resume than when you go for the interview and they select you ones details are asked for as it relates to education and employment. This company did not ask anything like that just all of a sudden they want your details and your friends or family members BIG!!

I received an email on Monday morning asking if I was interested in a job. I replied yes and asked for more information. After the second day I realised that this could be a. but I decided to continue with contact to see what else I could discover. I was raised by a person named Charlotte Natoc. I have stopped contact with her and have printed off all of the email responses. I will be going to my local police station to see if I can file a report.
After loading my resume online to look for work i was contacted by text message about a job opening. I was asked to email for more info. So I did. A reply was sent back soon including some job info and a long history of the employer and why they were opening a new pharmacy in my town including a story about his wife dying in a car accident and himself bound to a wheel chair. After said story i was asked for almost every ounce of personal info to begin the hiring process. I looked up the phone number that texted me and it came up as an area code from a de california. When asked for a face to face meeting over coffee I was again told that my info was needed first. At this point i am reporting the incident. No further emails have been sent at this time.
Company trading as Charmwell Holdings Ltd from China/Japan will send out an email to you asking to be there US/Canada Representative. They are collecting money owed to them by companies for construction equipment that was sold to them. The first person they get you to contact is a person by the name of Clyde Williams from Baycrest Assets Ltd. Then I had a check handed to me from Macrodyne technologies Ltd. for the amount of $65,717. 41. As far as I can see right now, this is a fraud to make money. Person of contact is Mr. Thomas Yogi. I've spoke to him over the phone, very brokenly. But seems like, but Im not sure that he is. The job seems to good to be true and must be a dream.

Best regards,              , as manager of "Corporate Business Solutions" This was the initial email I received, when I initially went on the site it looked ok so I applied.  Then         contacted me to set up a Skype interview.  In the mean time I did some research because the companies job information, pay and working options seemed a little too good to be true.  The first thing that I found odd was that when I looked up the Address on their " CAD and US head office " The Miami office did not even come up and aside from their own web site there was no real virtual presence for a business that advertised virtual services.  The business did not show on Miami's Business lists and then the biggest thing was seeing other reports on the BBB web site that was exactly like what I got.  Even more suspicious they offered me the job even though "        had technical difficulty and did not even interview me" when I pressed her for more information she provided nothing but the same information provided before.  Obviously I did not pursue but I would assume they would have followed up with the same things they did to other people that reported this company because they did say that the job would offer me all of the physical items I need in lap top, printer, and
All this started two weeks ago. I recently graduated and was looking for a part-time job opportunity until I find some full-time regular job position. I applied to so many jobs that sometimes I can not even remember that I applied for the particular job position. I received an email on 5th of July 2018 from CANEWS.TODAY and they claimed they reviewed my resume on indeed and they want to offer me a position of Quality Control Agent. It was a part-time position with a trail of 30 Business Days. They wanted me to go to the different places like bank, mall, hotel and Restaraunt as a customer to check their service and get back to them with the survey form that they provided me. First two days were good and I never realised that it was a dream, they sent me to a restaurant and mall for the first two days. On Thursday the 12th of July, 2018, they didn't send me an email regarding my task so I reminded them that I didn't receive and task and they said their server is down so I am off today. On Friday the 13th of July, 2018, they called me and said I need to go to the bank today and check their customer service as they received a complaint that they take more than 40 minutes on one customer. Afterwards, he said he will send me an order and I need to deposit that money into my Scotia bank account and send them back immediately to their company via Bitcoin ATM. I asked them if it is compulsory to do that as I was not feeling good to use my account to accept or withdraw the money. I told him that I am already a Scotiabank customer so I can ask the question regarding my account to check their quality of service but he denied me to do that and he said if I want to work with CANEWS.TODAY as a quality control agent or not as he manipulated me that he can promote me as a manager if I can keep doing this job according to their rules and regulations. I asked him that I am not feeling secure about using my bank account but he assured me that CANEWS.TOADY is reputed and nice company and nothing negative will happen on my bank account. He claimed that CANEWS.TODAY will pay for all the charges and expenses happen to my account. I did as he told me to do and he provided me with the location of bank and account bank. He sent me two interact e  transfer with the amount of $1990.80 and $1985.00 and I deposited the whole amount back in the account bank. When I get home I opened an account to check one of my payment that was supposed to go on 14th of July, 2018 but I was unable to open my bank account on the mobile app. Then I log in to my web to see if there is any kind of problem with my mobile app and then I came to know that my bank account is suspended. I called the Scotia bank right away and customer representative asked me if everything is okay at that point I was unable to hold anything back and I told her everything. Next day I went to my bank and got the new card. On Saturday that is today, my friend sent me an interact on my email when I tried to deposit into my bank account they said I need to contact my financial institute to check if everything is alright. I called my bank and them and my email is in the guest list and they need few business days to resolve this and they will contact me and interact department if they need any further information. Now my mail is in the guest list and my friend who sent me an interact of $500, his money is on hold and they sent his email in the finance department for further investigation. When I filled a job application for CANEWS.TODAY they wanted me to send my identification proof. I sent them my ID as an identity proof but now I know they are fraud and I don't want them to use my personal ID. I don't want this to happen with someone else so I am willing to provide all their emails that they sent me so any action can be taken against them. Below are the email and phone number that they were using to contact me. CANEWS.TODAY email is careers@canews.today and phone number is 604-283-4770. I still don't believe all this happened to me. I cannot shake the feeling of this fear. I didn't lose any money but I wasted my time and gas and now I am having trouble with my bank accounts. I cannot sleep properly because they are still out there and can use my information on anything. Thank you for your time and please let me know if I can take any further action against this person.
I received an email from Jessica Perez at High Tech offering me a position for online manager. after checking online I realize the company is less than 1 year old and the website is only about 1 month old, also the email addresses on the website info@bitbee-tech.com as well as the one for support@bitbee-tech.com come back as undeliverable because they don't exist.
OFFER A CRAZY SALARY FOR A SIMPLE AT HOME JOB.
I have contacted the Company that the men used as well as notified the person whom they where meeting.  They offered a remote position to work as a customer service clerk.  Saying they got my contact information from Indeed.  The job that they posted on Indeed was for carloans411.ca.  Anyone who says that they are from London using a bank account is the same.  They are asking for personal information such as bank and withdrawal amount.  The last step is asking for a photo of your ID.
offer job too good to be true, they hire me without any interview, and I was fitting all their vacancy, they just want me to sign the application form and send copy of my ID, company do register in Canada with some name as owner, other names shown in their site, no one of those names has any listing in any LinkedIn, face book or any other site., no active telephone number  as I tried to call the number and seems number is fake. communication via email but it seems cut and past email, with many grammar mistake
They offered a position of Online Assistant. They said they can't meet because they were in New York. But their IP address says it's from Kansas. They also said they were about to open an office in Edmonton on May 24. The names that contacted me were Gerta Meizen and Benjamin Crassberg. They said they the company is from Switzerland with the address Achereggstrasse 10, 6362 hectares, Nidwalden, Switzerland.
She calls you and addresses you by first name. They claim you have expressed interest in earning extra income on the side and that they have an offer for you. Said offer is a free account to use their software to trade stocks legally. They claim that in return for this offer, all they ask for is a 5% commission once your profits start rolling in. All you have to do is agree to sign up and download their free software and let it run. They say because you are using their software that all trades will be legal and licensed.
" The job/employment plan takes advantage of those who are seeking work. Individuals are offered a job without needing to have an in-person meeting with the employer. The target is asked to receive money from an now-compromised bank account. They are then asked to withdraw cash in order to purchase tickets.These items are, in turn, sent to the wallet address of the caller. Demographic of targets: The elderly, recent immigrants, the young (students with little knowledge of legal systems), and workers who receive payment under the table How it Works The target will contact a job worker through an email, or phone call, and offer them a job. If the job owner believes that this job offer is legitimate, they will accept their offer and follow the same to  subsequent instructions. The instructions will involve sending money from a compromised bank account controlled by the user, into the target's bank account  this is done via an e-Transfer. The target will then be instructed to withdraw most of the transferred money, with the difference being the target's compensation. The target is then requested to use the withdrawn money to purchase items at a Bitcoin ATM, and send them to the target's wallet address. When the compromised bank account's holder discovers money missing, they will report it to their local authorities, who will ask the bank to reverse the transaction. After the transaction is reversed, the target will be left at a loss, having already withdrawn the money sent to them. Prevention: Stay Alert The majority of jobs will require a physical presence for an interview. Always be skeptical when being offered a job. Be particularly cautious of any jobs that claim to be  in remote jobs  or  as work-from-home jobs. Be wary of any job offers made on-the-spot, through an email or a phone call, and without an interview. It is also very important that you  never accept money transfers from anyone you don't know. Most certainly, the chances are that the funds are coming from a compromised bank account. A job will also most certainly never involve conducting business out of a target's personal bank account. Any job that is easy to obtain, with easy pay, is most likely too good to be true. It is always good to have a healthy dose of them.
As I am currently unemployed, I have been looking for jobs on a lot of job sites and applying to a lot of different positions. As a result of this I had not been keeping track of which companies I had applied to. Thus, when Charlotte Natoc of Verttag Corporation contacted me with a job offering, I assumed it had been one that I had applied to. The first email I received was asking me to email back if I was interested in the job. The second email I received had an attachment describing the positions available, which were basic office jobs, as well as the pay. There was also a 5 day training period. I was asked to choose which position I was interested in, as well as answering a few basic questions: How do you feel about working in a team  What do you need to feel comfortable at work  What position are you most interested in  Why are you the best candidate for the respective position  What are your best personal qualities  When would you be ready to start working. About 6 hours after receiving the second email, I received another asking if I had received the email and to respond as soon as possible. I assumed that they were just trying to be nice at this point, and sent off my responses to the questions. The next email I received asked me to fill out an employee contract and send a copy of an official ID. It was at this point I started to get suspicious of the company. I had previously searched the internet for any information on this company, as well as looking at their company website. They are registered with a certified business number on the Canada Government website, as well as many others, and their website looks pretty legitimate. However, when I called their listed phone number there was no response and not even a call. In hind-site, this should have been enough to convince me, but I was still really interested in the position as it had good pay and I thought I would really enjoy the job as it had been described to me. So I filled out the employee contract, with my basic information (name, address, contact information, signature) and sent a photo of my driver's licence with the master number erased, as I was still unsure of the security of my information. The next email I received was to encourage me on becoming a member of their company. Up to this point I had not spoken to any one other than this one individual by email, I had not had a formal interview of any sort (just the few questions I had answered), and I had not even been told where the position would be located, as it was an office job. This email continued to ask me for my banking information so that they could set up my payments. At this point I dug deeper into this organization. Their address, when searched, is actually for a business called "United Consumers Home Services". While the Canada Government website does have them listed as a business, it is very unclear what they actually do. And finally, I called their listed number a few more times, and still there was no response. At this point I was pretty skeptical that this business was legitimate, so I responded to the email stating that I was happy to be offered the position, but I refused to give anymore information until I talked or met with someone, and was told where the office was located. The response I received is attached below, and basically told me that this was standard procedure and I should feel comfortable with the security of my information with them. Besides the emails I have described above, there were about 3 additional emails in-between that asked me if I had received the information sent previously and to respond again, even though the total length of our contact was about 3 days. However, since my last email, asking about the security of my information, I have not received any other emails, therefore I can say this 100% appears to be a lie. I am not sure what the procedure is to obtain a business number, but I have to believe that these people have been quite successful at finding people, as they have gone out of their way obtain a business number and to make their company appear very legitimate at first glance. I hope that you can shut down this business so that they don't continue to hire unemployed individuals at such a vulnerable time.
From the very first moment when I received the mail I knew something is tied up here, because A) there is a company with the same name duties in the different country then why it using two domain. B) It asked me to use my personal bank account until my probation period ends C)  $ 500 + commission per week for part time and work from home no one pays that much to a person with no experience.

This email came through with a vacant position for an IT specialist position. They provided a very vague job description, wanted personal information and image of myself and were willing to employ me without in person interview. Offered high wages and paid 10 day probation period. They lacked proper grammar, were persistent, wouldn't provide office address but stated they were moving to my area. IF SOMEONE IS GOING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A JOB AND NOT MEET YOU! NEVER BELIEVE THEM!
The manager must have known I been looking for a job off Indeed, I received a email of a possible job opportunity working from home. I was sent these forms to fill out the application and right away I was "the right candidate," it was just seconds after as if it were a automated message. The job is to work from home online, and you have a 10 day trial period. Great pay and flexible hours so it does sound to good to be true. I spoke with Amy       the "CEO, please," for the company and just speaking with her and trying to convey my concerns I knew I was not confidence to continue, I did more research on the task I was given, anything that relates to linking your personal financial account and taking money out of it and putting the money into a Bitcoin machine account just did not sound right. I did more research and the story just sounded like many other books. I email her saying I am sorry, but this is a trap and I will report you, at first she was so eager to answer my emails and after that I have not heard from her. Please watch out
The company emails you saying that you have qualifications for a new job that has been created, which is management of customer orders,and  market monitoring. They send you a Labour Agreement and Job Description.  Everything looks legitimate, with their Corporate Seal, you sign it and send it back. Then you receive  a congratulations letter,  and then they ask you for banking information for company  transactions to be filtered through. This is suppose to be only for a temporary until you get own   expense account.

How much will it cost to register as a Shop Inspector? Nothing. We will never ask you for any sort of payment to perform a visit. Do I need any equipment to become a Shop Inspector? Yes. You will need a laptop / computer / tablet and internet access so that you can update your reports. You may also need a camera (camera phone will be fine) to record any relevant evidence. Where will I work? You will work remotely in your city. Therefore, during working hours, you must be available for communication immediately. Communication takes place by e-mail and by phone. How much do you get paid? The rate of pay varies based on the costs, complexity, time, and location of a job assigned. All of this information concerning pay is clearly disclosed when you accepts an assignment. Payment for 1 assignment (30 $ -70 $)  Shop Inspector will also receive an hourly payment. Full time - $20.00/hour. Part time - $14.00/hour. When and how will I get paid? We will pay you per completed assignment immediately. Hourly pay is paid every two weeks. The story starts from the day when Shop Inspector actually took up his duties - when you completed a first assignment. In the process of employment we will ask you to confirm your payment details, your payment details will be kept secret and remain confidential. We don't share any of your details with any other third party. How will I get selected for an assignment? At Hot Review, we ask you to complete a story about yourself so we can select the assignments that are best suited to you and the area where you live. How long do the assignments take? If an assignment is to be completed on a certain date or during specific hours, then the date and hours will be included in the assignment instructions and you is expected to complete the assignment only during these dates and hours. If the time of the assignment is not specified, the assignment must be completed on the same day that the Shop Inspector accepted the assignment for execution. Each assignment should be completed as soon as possible when you have received all the necessary tools for the assignment.                                                                                                                   Looking at their website, it seems alright, but further inspection proves to reveal little. Firstly, their phone number does not work, secondly, their emails repeatedly mention the company "Golden Review" and a single individual "Jen Wells"... not only one person works at a company. The most famous line within their website is, "We don't just hire  out anyone.  and we certainly don't mass-hire everyone who applies", which is DEFINITELY something that someone who does exactly that would assert. These monsters are stupid and selfish, relying on desperate just-graduated individuals who are looking to survive in this capitalist driven          of an existence. The most IRONIC thing is that they're" hiring" investigators, who would be very detail oriented and sensitive to any strange occurrence, and thus would be most used to picking up on these red flags. Instead, they had a short phone interview with me, asking about myself and my job experiences, asking whether I was interested in part or full time employment. Immediately after the phone call I was provided with a job offer, where I had a contract to sign and a tip sheet...no banking information page/direct deposit form so they would be able to actually pay me.. but they're a loan so that's actually not necessary. Again.. DETAILS. Below is the contract attached with the club:                                                                                                                   Page 1 Hot Review, 3415 Rue Pierre-Ardouin, Ville de Quèmec, QC -3 +1 418 266 3772 info@hotreviewllc.com www.hotreviewllc.com EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT All shop inspector are Employee of company Hot Reviewer.

Be careful and pay attention.. The devil is in the details.
Out of nowhere, I happened to get an E-Mail from somebody that goes by the name of John. It was very odd to receive such an E-Mail with such a high paying opportunity, so I decided to look into it and ask for some more information. I couldn't find any info on this man that works at "The Logistics." There was also no information on the company itself, since it was all fake. I decided to not go forward with it and instead report it as a joke here so nobody else falls for it like I almost did. I did happen to get two documents, one containing a job description as a Code Word file, another containing a file for an application form. They both were clean files since I did a scan on my arm right after I opened them, but I still recommend not going forward with opening such things. An offer too good to be true, perhaps!
I received an email from them saying I got an offer for the position Customer Service Representative-Quality control agent, and that they got my application through      . I don't be ever applying to them. Attached in the email are the files for the job position and application form, that asks for name, address, contact number, and 3 character references. I initially got suspicions but I took a chance and filled up the said application form. The day after I received a call from a guy with an Italian-accent, saying I got the job and and asks me to send a copy of my ID/passport. I asked them about their office and told me someone is calling me after I send the requirements. That's what alerted me, more to fact that they are offering me space for 3 days a week. Searched them online, nothing comes up except for a basic looking website.
They email me that our team found your resume on indeed. They offer me a top assistant post on higher salary without any experience and also on part time job. They said we are going to open new office in your area so we need a good staff. They said we are going to hire you within 2 days then 10 days of probation period. On the second day of probation period they inform me that they deals in cash hence there client will send me fund in my personal account via e-letter transfer. In few minutes I got an email stating that Mr. x has annual fund transfer of $2700. I found the process easy and decline to do whatever they kept been saying. Now I have been getting these emails and phone calls
No Bank. Be careful with these companies. They convince you to take money onto your account and transfer stolen money. They also promise high pay and never pay for your work.
Far too high pay offered for job and personal info required for job such as driver abstract and personal search.
Offered an at home job but I cannot find this business registered.
SCAM - any company who asks you to use your own bank account for customer transactions is a FRAUD! Do not be bound by the promise of good wages  and  benefits, protect yourself and work.

I am not sure if this is a joke but it sent red flags as I am reading what they handed me. It is a potential job as a "teaching assistant". I never recalled applying, they only want to communicate online, no physical address, the company website info was vague, i found some names of the employees in their website as the same in a different Swedish/French travel agency website, they want me to do something pending their instructions before I am selected for interview, they want to use the accounts of their employees to transfer corporate funds as they are just starting their business. I did not reply anymore as I am not actively searching for a job, but would like to                                     help warn other potential victims.       
She e-mail me, likely getting my e-mail from my resume uploaded on Indeed. They offered me a job in their business (even though I have no business experience whatsoever and did not apply to them). Upon reviewing their website, I found that they used fake names and stole photos for their president and board of directors (taken from a random company in Alaska: https://www.ahtna-inc.com/about/management/). They did not attempt to take money from me as I stopped calling them once I was suspicious. The e-mail tends to repeatedly e-mail you asking you to complete their employment questionnaire. Written in somewhat bad English. Example below: Dear Dear, I am happy to be writing you on behalf of the Credosys Limited professional team. My name is Monica Reyad.

Received a mail that they were interested in my profile, posted on online job search engines. The offer was for 'Assistant Administrator' with great employee benefits and a salary of $106500/annually.  Post my confirmation of interest in the job profile, their coordinator, Tracy Jensen, sent an employee application form and contract for signing up, with your picture. They told me that I was the 1st candidate on their list of 20. After I sent out the signed contract, she told me that I have arrange for an office setup immediately which needs to be opened in Montreal and in return they need to open similar office in Toronto. I was told that I have to step by step follow her instructions, that she would keep sending me through 'her' app. She told me that they need to buy furniture from China for the new office. I sniffed cash/fraud when the first task she gave me was to transfer cash from my personal account to 'import' (to pay the vendors from whom furniture would be bought)- As per her, she would sent me money through 'Mint' in my personal account, which I would have to withdraw (Cash)from my account and deposit in Bitcoin. When I questioned her repeatedly that why I should use my personal account for work (since every penny coming in my account would be paid but I would be paying it off to vendors - hence its not my income), she said it is to check that the new hired employee is reliable. On my further questions, she VANISHED AWAY from 'the' and took off her picture as well :). I'm just happy that i'm saved and wish you also don't fall in the trap
I came across a job posting on Facebook by Claudia Logan who was looking for a personal assistant. She has my address, cell phone number, and email. She asked for my banking information and my password which I gave her so she can deposit money in there for me to do her tasks. She put in $2000 and asked me to send $1000 to Turkey and $800 in Chinese gift cards. I looked up the 2 phone numbers and called them and one phone number rang and then stopped and the other phone number had a male automated voice which is fake. Upon searching online through reverse look up the the phone number showed as a bank account so a mobile application. And the address she gave me is registered to another person with a different last name. She also said she would give me $200 for every race I ran for her and if the transaction to turkey through western union went through that I would receive a $100 bonus. I spent $100 of that $2000 from my credit card for her.

Somehow, a woman named Sarah Iyola got onto a Facebook group page that is used by York University students and alumni to share volunteer and job opportunities.  She posted that DATA ENTRY personnel are needed, for this company, and to message her for more details.  She provided me the email covance2018@gmail.com (RED FLAG RIGHT THERE) and told me I needed to add them on some again in order to interview and get more information. They asked for picture of ID, full name, and address, and a video saying I pledge to do my best and follow instructions of the company, and my supervisor.  It was to be a data entry position, that they would be paying me $20 an hour for.  They were going to send me a laptop, and funds to purchase software for the computer that I would need in order to do the data entry. That all sounded good and fine.  They told me I had to report online the next day at 9 am.  At that they started talking, and told me the computer would be shipping the following day, and I would have everything in 2 days. In the meantime, they needed my bank info so they could "send me money".  Yet they asked for my name and password, and security question and password (RED FLAG RIGHT THERE).  I told them that they can E-transfer me the money and I will tell them when I had it.  At this point I was very suspicious and started digging around online, and all the little clues came together. No international company would be using their company name and the year as their email address, nor would they be using a Google account. I feel like a COMPLETE IDIOT for falling for this, and wasting all that time and energy, and I hope none else falls for this horrible, disgusting, pathetic, man. I DID NOT lose any money, but I very easily could have.  As it stands, I am concerned about these individuals knowing my name, address, and having a copy of my drivers license.

I called them a few days later, saying I felt isolated and that they appeared not to have a local address and I was not interested in leaving. I received  this response: 'My name is Marvin Hansen and I represent the company Openium, SARL. I am a Manager.

I will admit that I contemplated accepting the offer if only for the paid training, but 'pro-currency' makes me uncomfortable because I know someone who was 'inspired' by a similar concept.  Mark again contacted me # 2 asking if I was still interested, I read the requirements and checked the company name again, this time 'A' links appeared. ( I did not specifically hear them mentioned but did notice similar 'offerings' on the web site. ) $40/hour seems like a LOT of money.
"Max Hill" contacted me via my home email, probably obtaining that via LinkedIn, telling me he was looking at me for an Operations Manager, sent me a posting, posting and asking me to apply.  I looked them up on the website, and applied.  Next email, he flat-out tells me I have the job - more than a little suspicious since we hadn't spoken, discussed my resume, nor had they checked my references.  I went back and studied the business further and none of the phone numbers were valid. He later also called me at my work email. I can send the job posting info, if you wish.
I posted an ad for work on Monday with my phone number and the owner texted me and tried to get me to deposit a check from a client of his and promised me a salary of $200 a week. I knew he was a lawyer from the picture that his client sent by email to me.

Sent an email about a potential job opening claiming to be apart of the IT department. When you confirm your interest to be contacted they send you an application form. Immediately they will accept it and send you an employment contract and ask for your banking details for direct deposit and a piece of ID. No phone calls, no interview. I called the number listed and it was a disconnected number. Website is fake.

Started with job promotion with 100% employee benefit and very attractive salary with $25/hour, job positions are office based or home based (online), which you would always choose home based, because they never contact you from the city you live in.  After you reply with interest, she (Tracy) sent employee application form and contract for you to fill out and signed, and that you have to reply within 48 hours, otherwise they will move on to the next candidate on their list.  They tell you that you are the 1st candidate on their list of 20.  Then they also would mention that they will open a new office in the city you are living in within 1 week or so (no proper date).  When I asked if I can have an interview or a meeting of some sort, and asked about the location of the new office, there is no more replies.  After that, no matter how many e-mail you send, there will not be any replies.  When you try to call the number provided, there is never anyone answer phone calls.  When you check on the map the address and the company name, you can never find the company.
I have been searching for a job using indeed. I did not apply for this position, however they contacted me via email. I decided to check out this company and the BBB site stated that the business is closed and also the business address is in another province. My gut tells me that this is definitely a fake, but how they got my information, I don't know.
A couple of months ago, I was offered a job by a company called Agsys Technologies. They offered me a job via email without any actual recruitment process other than emails. I did not get interviewed. This raised a red flag for me, and I found out that the business has been reported to BBB previously as a small company that tries to get their 'employees' to pay fake names. Recently, I received an email from Google IT that is almost a word-for-word copy of the email from Agsys, just changing a couple of words like the company name. This leads me to believe this was the same place, probably arranged for by the same people. I checked both companies and they are both federally registered in Canada, i.e. they are both in the Corporations Canada online database. So far! Even doing my due notice by confirming if the company was listed, they were still operating them, or at least attempting to. I hope the fact that they were incorporated would help with taking them down.
Applied for a paid job posting on a jobs site. The employer called and made a part-time job offer during a working period of 14 days, during which time I was to use my personal account to receive their money and deposit via their ATM for their "IT Specialists". I would have earned up to $15,000/week for their employees' salary. I had to send a picture of myself holding my passport and a scan of my passport. They also asked for my personal banking details. The pay was $17/hour.

Im applying jobs online and i chose this as Career, i tried to apply as a factory worker in England and they replied to me then asking to submit my documents and other documents that have to download via online like Cover Letter, email and other documents. Then they said if im having a hard time to complete all my documents they can help me to complete my application documents but before that i have to pay them 27 euros.
I was contacted by Brandi Michaels with email address brandi.michaels@angelichr.net, he said i was impressed by their recruitment and i never apply for job from them, and later he was asking for my bank details and asked me to signed some document and send it to him with my picture...
This people contacted me through email and phone confirming they gave me a job and i never apply for job at there so call company.i didn't know where they got my information from. The person that contacted me called his name Felix, and later i., i asked them lot of questions in which they couldn't answer, they lied to have an office at Madrid and looking to start a new branch in Paris and more. They asked for my bank account details, information about me and ID which i gave them because there website look so real and later i got to know they are real when i asked for there contact and they couldn't provide it...many people
I vaguely remember applying to this company, but there's a chance they simply found my resume on Indeed.com. They sent me an email saying they wanted to hire me as a secret spy, and the rates were good. I looked their company up and couldn't find any information on them  eventually I discovered that "Golden Foxe" had stolen the entire website of Market Force, a real company accredited by the MSPA and BBB.
They asked me about a job opportunity. I filled out their application. After checking a few emails I got skeptical. They don't have any type of interview, but they are willing to hire you (with no experience in finance) with an income of $24/hour. In their last email they asked for more personal and bank info. After that I never replied to them as I believe it is a dream.
I got a message entitled: "Job:Job Offer" from Alvinlee Coinbase. Here is the message: Good day Ms. (last name)! We're glad to welcome you! It is my pleasure to extend the following offer of employment to you from London. After reviewing your resume, we would like to offer you the position of Customer Support - Remote. Your experience will be an asset to our company. Founded in July 2012, Coinbase is a digital currency wallet and platform where merchants and consumers can connect with new digital currency like coins.

At the moment, we have open positions in Canada. You can see more information by clicking on the link https://www.coinbase.com/about.

After passing the training, you will have a meeting with a top manager, and you will discuss your schedule and salary together. Usually, it is from 67,000 dollars a year. Please let us know if you have any questions I will provide any additional information to you. Main Office in Canada 201 North - north .  Main, Winnipeg. They sent a secure link and a page with job description as well. Strangely, the person did not sign their name at the end of the email. I was applying for jobs using only one website and I could not find this company there. I also don't apply to these kinds of jobs, not being very technology-inclined. I am sure that I did not apply to this company. My resume on the website is linked with mine. I don't have experience. The money amount they are offering seems like way too much and the fact it is in U.S. dollars (I am afraid) seems suspicious as well. The address in Manitoba is also written strangely.  Plus, I would think that a tech company would have a company email and not just have email addresses. They seem like a legitimate business, so maybe a name is using the company name. I don't know. I decided it must be a trap and will have had no further contact with them.
Was rewarded with offer of a job. The job description was to go around different establishments and fill out surveys. I opened it and filled out an application form. They then called asking for a copy of my ID and I quickly sent it. My boyfriend then pointed out how crazy the whole thing sounded. I looked up the company number 10342465 which turns out to be related to a company in the UK. They have no website or address.
I applied for a job offer on Indeed website ( https://www.indeed.ca/viewjob?jk=284a6eee987661d7 and from=1 & desktop and tk=1chugbfonbdcheci ) and one day after application, I receive a message from a person called Benjamin Nick. He offered me this job to fix cars and I should receive $700 weekly as payment. He explained to me about the position and told me that I'll receive at home a check to deposit and use with expenses for this position (including with shipping). I asked for information about the company, but I didn't receive an answer. After 24 hours I send an e-mail with my address and 1 day after I received a check at home to deposit in my account. The value for this check was $2,975.30, I went to the bank and deposit this check. My check was $1,500 and I not even know about that. So, I thought this check was original and I proceed paying the shipping for the rest. 3 days after my account was frozen and totally blocked because of this fraud and the check was refused and now I owe to the bank more than $2,900.00. After this situation, I start to hate everything about this case. And here is all the information that I could trace it back: Name: Number (604)256-5087, this number belongs to a man in New Westminster, and my phone identified the person as 'Mark Logan". The check was sent to me by a company called "Silver Maple Ventures Inc." located in 350-1122 Mainland St, Vancouver BC, at1. The person who sends the check is called home and this check was sent from 618 Les Ave, London ON, L4K 4B4. I verified this address and belongs to Homewood Suites from Hilton Hotels. the number in my email was called Gain Plus Movers (gainplusmovers@disposable.com), and I've received a call from this number using the number 1-5458 and my mobile identified this number as GrandCentral located in Chicago, IL, USA.
Found job on nerdyhire.ca (website looks nice too) and was contacted by email. Filled out basic employee info form. Was accepted and now they want all of my personal data. Direct deposit forms, personal info etc. All of this without one phone call or interview or telling me I have the job. Yeah...too good to be true. Please investigate and advise me. Thanks
I received an email from Rachel Tenysson at the machines for a job offer. Found it strange cause I did not apply on this job.  I received a choice of 2 positions: cash management and operations manager.  Once I selected the job that suited be best she sent me 2 forms to fill out.. filled those out and she came back to me instantly that I was selected and then asked for my picture and account information, that's when I became even more suspicious and dug a little deeper to find out it is s a man! Not sure what they do with the information but I never provided her with my picture and account information.
I got a job offer through e-mail. It was an open position offering to pay $1100 a week. They gave me simple tasks to complete and called me for an interview on the phone. They e-transferred me a large amount of money and asked me to deposit it through a local ATM. Later that day my bank called me and informed me that it came from a different account, they stole money from another person and used my bank account to get the money. Because of this, i am now banned from sending and receiving money through email. I cannot use email transfer permanently.
I was laid off and looking for something I could do from home.I saw an agent on-line to start your own business, and I responded - the biggest mistake of my life. I got a call from Dave Thomas of Bedrock Media telling me how fantastic there system was and how easy it was to make money - every bodies dream right! He made all sorts of promises, and I believed him. I explained that I did not have the money, and he told me that if I took out a loan for the $2500, I would have it paid in 3 months. I explained to him that if it does not work, I would not even have food in my house, as I am not employed. He still managed to convince me that it would work. I managed to get a loan, but had to have it paid back in 3 months. I transferred the money to her, and then the problems started. They promised to have the website up and running in a week. It was there, but nobody could access it. After 3 months of constant calls, I was told that there was a system era, and that they could give me a new website, but it would cost more money - really I have not received anything for the money I have already paid, now they want more! I opted out and wanted my money back, after about 4 months, they agreed to pay me half of the money, but even after calling me and Matt for 3 months every second day, I still never received a cent. I had to pay back the loan, so I never paid any of my other bills, had no job or income. Not to say I am still trying to catch up on all the bills I did not pay because of this man, and there were days when we never even had food in the house. I can't believe that these people are so ruthless. Oh by the way, they have no accounting department, and they have no managers, and their company policy is to never ever call you back.
I was excited about a job, and applied, however now they are asking for more person info and using my bank info etc. I was surprised now i know for sure it must be a dream as i am a banker not a finance person. I haven't sent them any more info. But i would like to pass on the information to you so you can see for ourselves and possibly warm others. The company is Glanzmann Investments. They say they are from the 7,4950 Basel, Switzerland, and are starting a business in Calgary and in the USA (New York). The website is www.glanzmanninvest.ca. I thought I would add to your list, I can not find any info on this company other than their Canadian and US websites. No phone just a number, unless you contact them overseas.
I work for a Settlement Organization that helps immigrants and refugees. I received an email from someone in India. He wanted to know whether the Labour Market Impact Assessment (ERA) and offer of immigration eligibility was indeed legitimate. The documents that were allegedly from the Frank Stronach Family Real Estates company were clearly not associated with that company. He also sent documents that were allegedly from the Government of Canada. There were so many red flags on these documents: 1. The card came with a border that looked like it was made using an ancient version of Microsoft Word 2. The contact numbers for a. have both come up as possible from numbers on page 3. The Canadian flag logo is blue and looks like it came from a low quality # 4. There is something called an "Opinion by Date" 5. They included the names of other "New Employees (First Batch)", which would never happen as it is a breach of confidentiality 6. They say the position is for Engineering but that the occupation is not regulated 7. There are minor translations and translation errors 8. They ask for an immediate payment of $1542 USD for a work permit 9. The email address for the "Canadian Immigration Home Office" ends with i-gc.com to make it mimic an official Government of Canada email address 10. The phone number for the "Canadian Immigration Home Office" starts with "+91-" I could go on and on. I don't know who else to report this case to, or what else I can do about it. This fraud targets vulnerable populations and must be stopped. Thank you for your time.
Initially contacted my colleague through email about a research project for the Philippines, including mystery shopping and information collection. I was in contact with them and familiar with their strict guidelines for the research project they had given. I paid for all expenses and transportation for this research project (Caterpillar/Pacific Mining Dump Truck Study for Philippine Dump Truck Suppliers and Philippine Mining Companies). We agreed to do project in two phases, one for the suppliers of dump trucks and one for the mining companies. We commenced with the first phase, setting out to get pricing and information for Field Global Research from various agencies. We answered their questions and gave them all information collected together with photo files of our field work. Once I asked for initial payment for the first phase since January 2018, Parth      é has been telling me that payment will be soon transferred as his "accounts team" is handling all this. Parth       has been the most useless piece of garbage I have ever seen. We have been in constant contact and he has not replied with any of our terms. It is very strange and annoying that the research had been done in good faith and to our best yet he has not even given us any compensation. It is a shame by all means, as the research was nothing but free labor for this group of young people.
I was excited about a job offer as payment manager from this person names you      , I was asked to write an email transfer for 2000$ to my personal bank account and go to a certain bank to purchase it and send it to the new code provided to me through the messenger. The next day my bank account was emptied because the seller of the money had reported the transfer just after the fact. I have many emails from this old        o person stating that it is legitimate, however, after doing research, there is no contact number for this user, and the website is not legitimate. When i asked him that my bank account was reported he told me to lie to my bank about where the money came from, he refused to give me any contact information, i asked if i could speak in person and he tells me that the office wasnot in Calgary anymore and they are moved to BC. The contact number on the website is a fake number and the website is not valid. I donot know what to do as i gave them my information upon receiving the job offer at first before i was told i was going to be using my own personal bank account to get the money transfers. I was called and lied to and my bank account is now locked. I had expressed that i didnot feel comfortable after receiving the e transfer and he had told me that i cannot send it back and that if i donot complete the task there would be severe consequences. I have many emails to support my evidence.
They e-mail me saying they found my resume on              his app. Saying they wanted me to be their new Online Service Manager. They offered $1200 a week full time or $800 a week part time. We walked back and forth and I felt something was off, so I called them and couldn't find them, checked their website (which seemed legitimate at first) and checked the same website which had never heard of them. So I called their address, which is a vacant lot for sale in Quebec. They called me and asked for no personal information, except how long I had my bank account for. Which I found really odd. They wanted to transfer me money to buy things and asked how long it would take me to get to the bank, Which at this point I was really concerned. When they called they only asked for me by my first name. And they started with you are now our new online service manager. No interview. No details. Just I was hired. But after finding a vacant for sale lot in Quebec I finally was sure they are a team.
They are not listed in New Brunswick, no direct phone number, no postal code: I tried to look up their website but was not listed: they sent me the link that does work but if you look up the Foundation. ca it doesn you t work. This company says it is from Germany but no such company ever comes up in this name as well.

 I was denied an opportunity for employment, as currently I am looking for employment but this organization.  I was given a contract to work for a 10 day probation and would get paid for that probation period, then would have a position of Human Resources Assistant, with the salary layout in the contract.  I started my probation period with my first task - I was to place an ad on Indeed.  Then my second task was a little out of the ordinary.  (See below I was asked to withdraw the money from the e-transfer of $1750 - they gave me $50 and I took $1700, when then was turned into Bitcoin with the clients account.  I did this it worked out, then never heard from the organization again.  I sent an email - but of course heard nothing back.  (see below)     Dear            .  Our client will send you the funds via e-transfer (email) for payment sites. Our client will soon be sending you your initial capital (money). You will receive a letter from the king. You will need to activate the letter from the printer to your bank account (how to do it, I will tell later). You will need to get to the bank branch and withdraw money. Then you need to get to the next, strictly in accordance with the address that I will give you later. Please only follow my instructions and always stay in touch with me. If you have any questions you can always ask me. I will provide you all necessary information and details regarding your task. I will prepare everything for you, so don't worry. I am here online with you to help you. I'll find nearest addresses of Bitcoin's, and let you know. Find the nearest ATM Bitcoin in your area. Deposit money on Bitcoin Wallet ( 1wb2Bs9NcVv3MXUxgvhBYKcLRDbFfNe89 ) of code ( code) of the Wallet attached. Read the Q code ( code) on your phone, or print it out and take a paper to theM with you. You will find the code installed within the ATM and you need just scan the ID code. Take a picture or scan a text and send it to me. If you have alternative method of car buying, please inform me. Dear         , I have not heard from you any more, so I am going to assume that we are not continuing with my contract. I wanted to touch base to say how disappointed I am in myself for believing that Staff and Jobs Staffing Solutions Inc, was a real organization. You took advantage of me and made me believe that I would have a chance after the probation period to work as a Human Resources Assistant. I was looking forward to the challenge, but I guess I am the fool here. Do know that I will do anything in my power to report your organization and the items you are selling to people who need employment. Remember, KARMA will find you all. 
I received an email indicating they got my resume from indeed.ca website. The email looked suspicious initially but I have considered it now. The first email didn't even have a email signature (nor the the follow up emails). The grammar and sentence structures were a bit off but I ignored. They offered Online Service Manager position with a pay of $1360 for Ft and $670 for IT work. Nothing job specific expressed other than vague duties. I accepted it and was sent a labour agreement to sign. I have it to my lawyer to review and he found a lot of errors and issues with the contract including a non permanent place named - Canada Court of Arbitration, for settling any issues based on this contract. I reached out to say I am ready to sign but requested a face to face and no one got back. I looked up the company and it is an active registered corporation in Canada. However, they made two address changes and the third address, as well listed on website, is an address for another business - oriented Business Development Center. The first two address were a house and a apartments, respectively. My lawyer claimed there is no harm in. Sign the contract but once they need to pay, they will require my SIN number and with all the other info they already have, this poses a I'd fraud scenario. Company was registered on 2017 and in the labour agreement email, the contact describes the e company has been operating since 2009. Please contact for details, personal items and further notes or questions. Thank you for your time and please get this out there. There could be people fallen victim already.
The company is pretending to be in Turkey, and giving unbelievable offer with many good lines doesn't match with market demands. When you go to web site and check its history you will see it was created only 2 months ago, even calling the phone number they put giving no results, and for their bad luck they said they have many branches one in Dubai where I tried to search online and didn't get any results. Fraud or that mean is simple, you have the offer, but you pay for visa application and once you get your residence visa you come here and we pay you back. Of course no decent company is doing that, and the answer as expected is nona be Visa is rejected and no return to you.

First she contacted me by email her name was Rachel Tennyson. I never applied for this position. They gave me option for 2 positions operations manager or cash manager. The operation manager position offered 108,900 annually and the cash manager position was 89,000. They said I was there top choice out of 20 people. As I read the email I noticed she spelled words wrong and made small pronunciation errors the first email looked copied and dated. The forms they sent seemed almost all spelled correctly even the last forms seemed to have a stamp of approval. They gave me the job after filling out 2 forms and no phone call. The number they did give when you call it all you get is a robots voice all lines are full call back later. Sounded like a small box at the end. I did some research they have a employee comment on glass door but it was only positive. Also they are hiring everywhere to work on the machines but only one big business location no head office just contact numbers. The website seemed very thoroughly made. Kind of expensive but the number again was robotic with no official head office location. I called the Kelowna branch they were in. They said this is the second time they have been called this month. The other position was a relocation job to Quebec and it paid 104,000 annually. This was a difficult position. They told them they aren't hiring for that job there vacancy was full. Unfortunately the Operation Manager refused to talk to me as well. It wasn't a fake email it had @machiningltd.com at the end. So again I didn't see any problem with it. They also said no phone interviews will happen because they information will be confidential so no information will be leaked to their competition. Than they made download an app called the messenger. Where they would contact me through that again no phone interview. My suspicion arrived when they said that this would be how the customers pay. How you will pay for an office. How you pay for supplies with it. This is where I declined the position and deleted everything.
They rewarded me with a position as a human resources assistant. Choosing between part time $1,100 per week from home, or full time in office $5,000 a month. They claimed they're opening new offices in many cities, yet there is no Toronto location. Had me sign a probation agreement (10 day probation training from home and get $700). Had me sign the agreement and take a picture holding it so they could see my face. When calling their office in Vancouver no one answers and the voice states "the text number you're calling is unavailable" its not even a real voice? They also claim to be affiliated with                   a well known local person who works and runs a company on Bay Street, in Toronto, Canada. I am extremely concerned since they have my home address, email, and phone number, and signature.
I'm a newcomer to Canada, and so I was applying for many jobs online. One day, I get this job offer to work online for a recruiting company, and the salary was very high, so immediately I was more than happy to take the job. I first had to do the training for 10 days, which was what they called my "probation period", and everyday we had to do a task. I only got to do two, the first being, posting a job offer on Indeed, and the second one being, receiving $1500 in the bank through an e-transfer (which works when you give only your name, your email,and the address of the bank you use)  and posting it in a local bag for a client. Now I looked up a lot of things about things because I didn't know whether to trust them or not, and they seemed okay, it seemed like a lot of people use them no problem, but what I constantly hated myself for is that it never came to my mind, I never asked myself, not once, why they would have me do it, instead of doing it themselves, if it wasn't illegal. Now, after I stopped receiving emails from them, and because I wasn't paid whatsoever, I realized that it is indeed a fake company. Anyway, I've learnt my lesson, I'm never going to go near an online job unless it's on a big trusted website like Yahoo or Freelance. Be careful who you talk to online, not everyone is going to be genuine.
James Cody contact me through LinkedIn and requested connection. Looked as if he knew over 40 of my top executive connections. He asked me to partner with them to work from home and $3,000.00 per month plus 10% commission for very little work and easy money. Only nothing, no travel and very high pay in return. He instructed me to contact Erik Shen and he would send me all job information. I checked the Scam Tracker and noticed this was done in the past in a nearby city. They want you to collect money from people in your own name. I did not go that far, as soon as I seen this alarm alert on BBB Scam Tracker I suddenly stopped.
I was initially contacted by a 'Karen Jones' a Human Resource Manager from NAS Capital Management Inc., saying she had found my resume from Indeed.ca.  They were looking for an Online Service Manager and my resume seemed to fit the bill.  I was a little concerned at first due to the lack of information that seemed to go in to the email, there were plenty of small mistakes and poor grammar use.  I brushed it off at first because when I checked their website it seemed professional and legitimate and the opportunity was too good to pass up.  As I filled out different forms (each sent as quickly as I could fill out, also suspicious) my suspicions grew.  Then when I was accepted and was able to start my probation period (of 5 days) I was told by Darlene that I would need to set up a personal loan wallet and they would send me money through interact e-transfer to purchase the Bitcoin to fill my wallet to pay for the transactions I would be making on behalf of various businesses NAS partnered with.  When I expressed my concern to Darlene over email about the use of how she called me, she sounded very foreign, could barely speak a lick of English.  She explained to me that I would be purchasing cleaning materials, construction materials, and other building supplies for their partners.  I told her thanks but no thanks and hung up.
 I Received an email offering me a new position in a new and growing company. I replied asking where they were mainly located and if they were going to conduct an interview. I was advised they operate mainly online and a meeting would be held after the training period. I noticed the website had a head office location listed, however the person corresponding identifying as head of the IT department did not mentions this. This was the email. I received your message.    I would like to tell you about our company. My name is Ruby Parr. I am the Head of the HR Department. Our company mainly works online. At present, we are expanding our staff and making it better. In the 21st century, the whole industry is going online (the Internet).

This is to teach you some special skills (such as working online, the site studies, ability to work with clients. Study and search this and many more).  Carefully read the Agreement for Probation Period, then fill it. ("Agreement for Probation Period" exists only for probation period(10 days), after completion the probation period,you will be provided a general contract with our company, which you will fill out at the branch of our company). 1.You must send us the first page (scan or photo) 2.Also you must send your photo with the last page in your hands (which is your signature) so that your face and signature could be seen. Example: The state law does not allow us to require from you any documents confirming the identity. Please send the link of your Facebook or Linkedin page. After the probation period, we'll require you to bring the documents to the office or read them. Your first stage in the company will be an internship.  You will have a personal meeting with us after the internship. During the internship you need to stay online all the time. Best regards, Staff and Jobs Staffing Solutions Inc., Ruby Parr A previous email asked me to link my personal social media accounts instead of personal ones... smells like Fraud. If they are such an online based company, an online interview would be expected. My resume is good but a specialist no interview?! Be careful to everyone reading this.

Email states that they are looking for Client Service Representatives, offering a flexible schedule, full-time hours and a starting bonus and higher than average wage. More than a few small errors in the email as well as a closing date long past. No phone numbers  or website information provided.

I was recently offered a part-time position as a Customer Service Manager with this market research company. I was initially contacted through the job search engine indeed.com by one of the company's executives. Only a few questions were asked of me before I was approved for the position. Questions included my full name as it appears on my ID, address, phone number, date of birth, where I do my banking. All correspondence was done via email at first. My first assignment required me to deposit a check into my personal bank account and keep part of the funds as payment and the rest was to be used for my assignment. Specific instructions were promised to accompany the letter and letter. However, upon reading of said letter and request, instructions were then only to be given after putting the funds in my personal account. This is when I really got nervous and decided to consult with my accountant for advice. He convinced me that the info I had shared with him led him to believe this to be a scheme, a money fraud or fraud enterprise. I decided to trust him and my gut and so I have declined the position. I am still waiting for final correspondence in reaction to my refusal of the assignment and instructions for the return of the child. The image I attached is of the initial email I received, asking if I would be interested in learning more about the opportunity. I have saved copies of all other correspondence, including the letter that accompanied the letter.

I was contacted by someone saying they were this company, which was supposedly based in Toronto and they would be opening a new office in my city (Ottawa). They said they were taking several positions and was I still interested in an Administrative Assistant job.  If so please respond with my full name and telephone number stating I am interested in a telephone interview. A few days later I received a phone call and telephone interview. A couple days after that I was sent another e-mail stating that I passed the interview and they were interested in hiring me. They said they wanted to send me a check by mail to buy supplies to help set up their new office. They asked for my full name, email address and telephone number so they could send me the letter. I found this very suspicious so I called the business name and address and nothing came up. So I came on here to do a search for them and found many similar scenarios. I stopped communicating with them after this. I am guessing they would eventually ask for my S.I.N. or banking information to process my pay and try to set me blind.  I hope this helps prevent others from being taken advantage of.
 The following email was sent to me for job offer. The amount they offer for part time is $1000 per week and full time is $5000 per month. I tried very hard to find anything online about this company, but i was unsuccessful. Their website indicates they have been in business for 20 years, so there should be something online. They indicate they are a member of Access.org, but when i searched them i did not find their business listed in the directory. Their website is also design by online website design application, i am puzzled how they can offer that substantial pay to their employees, but cannot afford to hire a professional designer.

The attachment contained offer of German and in writing in the titles (i can read. so i was able to spot it) I was then contacted by someone on the phone who advised me if i am interested to reply to the email address. After i replied I am interested in the position, i have not heard back from them.
This lady offered me Operations manager position with a high salary. She said she got my call from indeed.com. I have posted my blog on indeed.com. Without any interview she provided the employment contract. Then she said she guide me to open new office in Montreal. She said she would never transfer funds in my account and have to withdraw and take it to Bitcoin ATM and send it. At this point I became suspicious. I asked why I need to deposit money via paper to my account and withdraw and send it via email. They could gave done it themselves. I keep asking more and more logical questions, they could not give me any satisfactory answer except by saying they need to see how wrong I am with money. Oh that. I got alarmed. Thank God i didn't agree to receive money and transfer funds via email. I want everyone to get warned about this place.
Offers a job and gets you to use your bank account to make transfers through e-transfer from one client to another and then uses their cards to transfer the actual cash to another. Your bank account then gets a warning and charges. Locks you out of your account. It's obviously stolen money and this is how they are handling the money.
Got a call from some lady in Australia, despite me being in Canada, about if I wanted to work as an "Online Trader". Didn't really specify what i'd be doing, but said that I'd be making $1000 a month, but had to pay them $500 to open/active my 'Traders Account'. She kept ignoring me because I said I was a genius and can't make 'US' only 'CAD'. Once she tried to transfer me to their finance manager to pay them I hung up and ignored their second call. Not to mention, that during the entire call, there was a LOT of LOUD noises in the background of just other people talking...
Contacted me about a job opportunity, that had a high pay scale for what requirements were needed. They stated that it would be a 14 day trial period and you would be paid by wire transfer. First day of the  legal trial period,  the contact said that they were just getting the accountant to send a text (interact email transfer) and I would need to go to a bit coin bank and sent them the bar code. I thought it was too good to be true and with that request I knew it was.
Received email and attached PDF file. Said they had employment opportunities for me. I've been using the Indeed website to look for jobs and this must be where they got hold of my CV.

This company contacted me through a ad I posted on it about looking for work, so I get a phone call from this lady name Jasbir Sekhon  and  Jess(for short) who schedules a interview with me the same, so I go for the interview, during the interview i was having a hard time understanding her and so I kept nodding, she went through it really fast and it came down to her asking for my social insurance number which I couldn't remember so we then proceeded to my house to grab my sin number, before I go grab it she says oh and grab your Credit card and I told her I only have debt she said that she s ok, so I asked her why and she said I told you already,did you forget. After all that we get to her office and she tells me that I have to pay a fee for the site, I told her I don't have any money to pay, then she just goes and pays for it with her card which I felt that was forced upon me cause I didn't ask her to pay for it or even want to join the site, then she tells me write down all my debt card information and the date, which I did.Then she tells me to get a blank check from my bank and drops me off at the bank, so I go and ask for one, the lady at the bank gives me a weird look and asks why, I try to explain to her and she is s still confused as to why I need a blank slate. So I get picked back up and I told Jess what happened, then she she s like thats ok you you ll pay me cash, and I questioned her again why I need to pay this fee, she said it is s for the training and for the site but before all this she told me the training was free. Then they expect me to walk around all day and recruit people the same way she did to me without getting paid cause apparently I she m my own business, is what they kept saying to me when I asked how do I make money from this company. Then she finally tells me that I get the money back when I'm done, so what is s the point on paying for that if you get it back and why do you have to pay a fee for a company that stops hiring you. Doesn't make sense. So I requested my money back and told her I don't want to  do work out  for them anymore, but their holding my money and keep telling me to go to their office so they can explain to me but they already explained to me 4 times already and I keep hearing the same thing from them. I still don't know how I'll make money from the company.All I know is They took $131.25  from me...I have to recruit people to get promoted without pay and they have my debt card information with the date and my social insurance number.
I was employed at IBM on Twitter during 2017. The owner      also failed to pay me for the last two pay periods of my employed and that ended being the reason why I terminated my employment. After numerous attempts to work it out privately. He has ignored all attempts of contact and denying that he owes me said money. I worked my ass off for him to only learn he is a fraud and in debt with the CRA and other agencies for loans.
While looking for a job, I received an e-mail from Richard West at Capio Business Solutions Inc stating that they have a good salary and position waiting for me if I choose to e-mail them back and accept.  I asked questions which were not answered in their original e-mail and they sent me a copy of the job offer.  Included in the offer was the following: "It is home based job. You will work from your home. Using your phone or laptop." "Bank account for work: During the trial period you may need to use your personal bank account. Your account will only be used during the trial period, after passing it you will be provided with a company account." It sounded like a fairly decent offer to work from home up until I read that I would be using my own devices and bank account.  They sent an e-mail directly and claimed to have found me on the job website website, which I had been visiting daily.  The letter was well written and formal enough to sound real, so if you went over your e-mail, you might miss important details. They also sent a Labour Agreement which stated, among other things: "5) Disability: In the event that the Employee cannot perform the duties because of illness or disability for a period of more than 1 week, the compensation otherwise due during said illness or disability will be reduced by 50% percent. The Employee's full compensation will be reinstated upon return to work. However, if the Employee is absent from work for any reason for a continuous period of over 1 month, the Company may terminate the Employee's employment, and the Company's obligations under this agreement will cease on that date." This is not in accordance with the Human Rights Tribunal or Employment Standards Act. I did not continue the e-mail conversation, and their website has apparently been up since 2010 although, according to the Government of Canada, their business has only been active since February, 2017. As you should never have to provide personal bank account information to your employer, I am asking you to look into their business.  Their business number is 825640055RC0001 and located at a residence in Newmarket, Ontario.
I was contacted by this business via email. They claimed to get my email off indeed jobs. They offered me a position as an office assistant in Sydney capetown. All I needed to do was to fill out a form and a copy of my drivers license and pay it back. Which I did. The next day, someone was suppose to call me, which no one did. I then received an email asking me to deposit a check they were going to send me. The check would be for 2000 dollars and to send a picture of the girl and all info. Obviously I knew here it was a trap. When I have tried to phone this number, it is s a cell phone that no one answers.
This is from me searching for a position on the job site "Indeed". Wanted to alert you to a JOB, with regards to the company "Corporate Business Solutions". They have address listed in the following  U.S.A:200 Biscayne Blvd, Miami, FL 33132 Canada: 275 Main Street, Ottawa, ON K1P5H9.  THIS IS THEM:  Our warehouse manager just informed me that we don't have anyone in our warehouse at the moment. They will receive new equipment after June 11th. Starting  from 2015 we buy office equipment with a 30% discount in our customer's online store only. They are receiving the payments on their "cash" wallet only, but our clients are unable to make payments on the "other" wallet at the moment. Our director just offered to our clients to send the money to you for your office equipment (about $1500 CAD). After receiving the money from our accounts, you should pay $1500 USD for your office equipment - send the money to the online store's "cash" wallet from any nearest "local" bank. After the payment you will receive your equipment in 1-2 days by express mail. You may find the nearest "true" "" in town. There is not any transfer fee. You don't need to spend your own money for this! The fastest way to send $1500 USD to you is "The e-Transfer" system. Have you ever used "the e-Transfer"? On the surface it does look a like a real opportunity, but when they final get to this above point in one weeks time, after what I now know is a wasted week.  It is obvious that it is a job deal. Has anyone else reported this company under "Corporate Business Solutions" or any other company name?  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
Got mail from Ryan Taylor offering the job Asset manager position. If you try to call the number it won't work. Next day I got mail from same person asking to download the app you will connect with Jonathan Smith. He will ask for personal account details. I feel it's completely illegal what they do. Please be aware with such mail.
Sends them in mail then wants you
They contacted me through email. Then sent me a letter regarding the positions. Never heard of them and I decided to check out the company, especially when they said they were moving to Edmonton. I could not find them anywhere on Better Business Bureau nor at the address they listed. I'm thinking this is a plan similar to one I almost fell for a few years ago when jobs were hard to come by. When that company said they needed my banking information to transfer funds for purchasing bit cards, I suggested I open a different account and not use my personal one. Haven't heard from them after. This feels the same. I chose to send it to you and then lose everything. I did not download anything to my computer. Everything is in my email. Thank you
They are supposedly hiring models for their clothing line but the requirements are that you have to buy one of their shirts and model it. They will put it up on their posters but people never get paid. This is their way of getting free advertising and sales. I have talked to a lot of people who lost money for this

Also want to note, if you signed a contract, you can not refuse and you will have to fulfill all obligations. Regards, Manager: Dorothy Logue Business Tour Travel I first learned about the company through an Indeed ad. I was then asked to fill out a legal form and then I was contacted by phone and told that I'd receive an email about the next steps.
This company contacted me because i was looking for work.  they seemed fairly quiet except for a few things. first they offered a "probation period"  where you would be an employee just for signing a contract.  and then you would meet with someone to fill out the rest of the paperwork.  The salary for this probation period was less than minimum wage in my area.  that was the first clue, the second clue was the bad grammar the teacher used. when they asked me to send a picture of my face with the signed contract is what led me to call the police.  There is no insurance company that would ask you to do so.

Was contacted by CNC Machining Ltd via email after posting my resume on indeed. The initial email stated they had two job choices and that i met their ideal qualifications. They asked that If I was interested in either of the companies, to reply and they would send a full job description. They offered a large salary, with benefits including full medical, dental and vision, 4 weeks paid vacation, company iPhone and laptop, gas card etc. The phone number provided on the email as well as their website it is s a computer automated voice and after requesting to speak with them on the phone they will only email and send generic responses. After attempting to research the company online, little to nothing showed up, until I checked here and search for  a and data  and an almost identical story from someone else came up.
I had been applying for tons of jobs, so when a company sent me an email requesting a phone interview, I didn't think anything of it.They explained that they were rooted in BC, but that they had purchased office space in Ontario and were going to be opening a location in Toronto. Before the interview though, they offered me a full time position with quite a decent salary considering the only experience needed was high school. They said they would start me on a two week probation period, which I told them I couldn't start until the following Monday because I had to make arrangements with my current job first, which they said was fine. The next day, they texted me four times, all of which went unnoticed because i was at work, followed by two emails telling me they required me to start the next day, as their CEO was planning to come down the next week to finish the office rental agreement. At this point I figured it had to be a dream of some sort, but decided to continue just to see what was going on.They sent me over an official looking contract which they had me fill out and sign, along with sending a picture of myself holding the signature. Now that brings us to my first day of training, in which they had me fill out a job posting and post it on an online board. That was simple enough. The next task was to post another job posting on an online board, except this time it was going to be paid. They explained that no money was to be coming out of my pocket, and that they'd transfer me the money in 2 or 3 minutes so I could purchase it to post the job online. Obviously as soon as they requested my banking information I email them back saying I was no longer in need of employment, and deleted the job they had me post. If the job offer seems too good to be true, it most likely is.
I'm looking for a better job so I have been applying to a large number of positions.  I received a message saying that I had been accepted as a staff assessment officer.  They said it was in response to an advertisement and a link to the add was provided. I did some research and found that this was a real company and there have been no cases involving them.  They said I would be doing an assessment of businesses as a sort of secret society.  At this point they had not asked for any information that was not already on my resume.  They handed me a package. While I was waiting for it I called the contact person who was listed as Diego Messenger. On the surface their answers appeared good but, I was getting a little suspicious. They said everything would be in the package.  When I got the package it only included three pages of material and a large pen. When I called to confirm some details my suspicions were confirmed. I they were much more worked about me paying this check then what I would be doing. They also did not have pre-arranged locations for me to go to.  This went against everything they said before.  I took the package to the police station and they confirmed it was a fake. Then I also informed the bank named on the phone.  I did not loose any money but, it I had was that check I'm sure I would have.
Upon finding a job opportunity (work-from-home) on craigslist.ca, I sent an email with a cover letter to the publisher of the post. The day after, I received an email saying I was selected as a potential candidate and that I needed to complete an online application. During the process of completing my online application, it required me to include my social insurance number - which I was most definitely not comfortable with (especially because it was an online application). I then proceeded to check their website and the links, including their social media links such as Facebook, Twitter and Twitter. All three links did not work and it did not lead me to their supposed pages, which further increased my speculation that it might be a trap. I don't know for sure if it's a lie but asking for my social insurance number online is a bit scary to me.
I was asked to do an online job for Dell EMC as some kind of customer service. Once the trial began she asked for my bank info which I gave. Then she said a deposit would be made through it and my next step was to go to a Bitcoin ATM and deposit money into the given bar code account. It was quite far away and she said take $50 for a taxi and do it within 2 hours of the deposit. I then received phone calls from her. She had a thick Italian accent and I could not understand her very well, but I was not comfortable doing anything for her.
The company suggested that I successfully applied for a position within "indeed" but they offered me another position "Online Service Agent" where I was basically asked to receive money and exchange it for cash upon completion I would receive a bonus of 3% for the payment that was received. They said it was a 5 day probation period that was only completed by 3% commission of payments made. And that after a successful interview a 45 day trial at the company's office would be provided with a $200 plus 3% commission basis. The company asked for Driver's License ID and bank information. Once provided they followed with instructions on how to commence the "training" and also that they could not let you use the E transfers as the system was "down" so they asked for your credit card number. They never provided a phone number to contact and when I called them to ask them to call me there excuse was that they were someone's on a business trip (New York) and could not make the call as it was too expensive.
This organization listed an opportunity for a stay-at-home writing position for a really good salary on campus. After applying for the position, they sent an email asking me to complete an online application form for the job and to use a reference ID number that they sent in the email - which looked like an automated response. Once you go to the website to complete the application it asks you for your social insurance number, all of your personal information, a photo of your drivers license and your drivers license number. When I saw this I looked the company up on Google and found that there are a few different people saying that this company is a bad employment. Some said they were asked for money when they did an online session, and others stated that they were asked for money after completing an online interview. I filled out false information and waited to see what would happen. I received an email saying that the position I applied for had been filled. However, I had applied the first day the ad was posted on Google, there were supposedly 14 open positions, and they had replied to me within 24 hours to set up an interview so that's pretty much impossible. Next, the email said that one of this'staff's friends' had an open part-time position and I should text them. I didn't do that because I had no idea what would happen, but this seemed super weird. Definitely a great way for them to collect too much of your personal information/serious identity theft concerns. check out: https://www.scamadviser.com/is-gtacareers.ca-a-fake-site.html https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/718j0w/is gtacareersca a job scam/ http://forums.redflagdeals.com/anyone-have-experience-gta-career-limited-1135929/ For examples of people talking about it being a fake.

They offered employment and asked me to set up a bank account and provide details so they could transfer money in cash and then release it to their clients.  Their website cannot be accessed and the phone number when called always goes directly to voice mail.  They were intent on me getting a higher withdrawal limit as well.  It all seemed very suspicious.
I initially applied for this job on glassdoor.ca I received and email the next day offering me the position with "too good to be true " salary, with an option to work from home or out of an office. When I replied back to what benefits came with the full time or requested other information, I did not receive any reply. The next day the person sent me the same initial email again, asking me to respond to them. I replied again with my questions and no reply. The day after they sent the email again, so I decided to play, and asked them what info they needed and right away they replied with the agreement and a detailed email explaining things to why online play is the future. "You must send us the first page (scan or photo). And take a picture with the last page (which is your signature) so that your face and signature could be seen. The state law does not allow us to require from you any documents confirming the identity. Please send the link of your Facebook or Linkedin page." From the Email No information available about this company online other than their website, and their job offers on every job board
I was contact via email about a work from home position. I filled out an application and called it back. Within a few hours I received an email stating I had the position with no interview.
Originally asks you to post a job on indeed the move to LinkedIn. After that asked you for your bank info to transfer 3 sums of money to be transferred into it

Offered a job in the "financial department with a starting wage of 29.50 CAD. Did not go through with it after looking through their company website which is full of errors and inconsistencies. The website layout is very well designed but too suspicious. Grammar is not what you expect from a international shipping business. The "customers" they have listed don't exist. The customers names are mostly identical to each other. Stay away from this. Connection to the server is not secure or closed
I can't say for sure if this is a trap but it seems suspicious. They have job openings on nearly all job boards so I sent in my resume. I got an email back today saying I got the job of human resources specialist (something I'm not qualified to do) and was asked to reply with how many hours I spend on a computer in a day (very odd question) and whether I'd like to work full time in the office or part time from home. The whole email was done oddly and there was a job description included that was also read strangely and even said you don't need any qualifications to work for them but you will be paid a lot. I didn't reply and they sent a second follow up email which I also did not reply to. They have a good website but a Google search of their company name yields no results. They say they have been around in Canada since 2000 yet there is no mention of them online anywhere. They have multiple locations listed on their website but they aren't specific enough (such as the address of a strip mall but not the specific unit number). If you see the addresses they don't link back to Eternal Radiance Staffing Solutions (some appear to be available for rent) and on street view there is no sign indicating they would be located there. Again, I can't say for sure that it's a joke (Ive never spoken to anyone from the "company") but things just aren't adding up!
City Financial provided me with three potential positions, two of which were part-time at home and part in the office. The company shows only a Toronto address but indicate they are hiring across the province. They asked interview questions, then an employment agreement, then said I was hired and asked for banking details. When asked to talk to them or where the office is they said once all the details were received they would give the information. The company seems to exist online and has  no legitimated  corporate details but the phone number does not work. They keep going asking for my banking details, but the grammar is getting very bad, and the message more urgent.
I received an email from a man by the name of                 k, he said in a later email that he was from Sweden and the company is from Sweden and has offices in Canada and USA. What made me suspicious about this job offer was that I don't recall ever applying for a job named Zedar Consulting and I don't know what he meant by he saw my VC online. Also, I could not find much information about the company to support or deny its existence. I have attached one of the 5 versions of the emails I was sent.
They found my resume from career website and contact me if I am interested in being an online service manager. They don't have location in my city which makes hesitate.
I receive email from this company because I applied lots jobs on indeed. I am not sure if I apply to this company, but this company heard me saying want to hiring me. I was waiting for any phone interview, but there is no interview. They don't have office is my local and they say they will have a office open in my city in next month. Website is under maintain when I check it. They have send me job agreement and form for personal information to sign.they say they will pay direct deposit, email transfer or check. I am hesitate.
I received a job offer via email for a Online Service Manager seemed to be that but the process was far to easy and i was offered the job within days. The original Email seemed to be a lie. The web site looked up until i found a link to a US firm Total IT (totalit.com) witch just happened to have an identical website. Multiple attempts to contact both companies via phone or email failed other then the link to the original email source. Traced the Total IT phone number to an address in New Mexico. Another reason i believe it to be a joke is that condition of employment was to create a bit coin account that they would have access to.
Looking for work. Was contacted by someone saying she found my resume on a job seeking website ( one i use on a daily basis). She states in the email her company was trying to contact me for an administrative job.( no emails or phone calls or even job applications filled out in that regard). Explained i didnot get anything. And i have 5 days before the job is taken. Asked for more details. send another email stating the same but in a different font then saying i had the job for this company? But the email didnot change anything. They had to send paperwork if i accepted. The whole 27.00 to start wage( which seems odd to begin with for the description of this basic position). Ca, find any info on her or this " company" unless its linked to the uk.
I was approached by email about a job offered title Payment Manager paying full time 29.50/hour too good to be true I been applying for Accounting Clerk jobs for the past 4 months and all they pay is around 18-22 per hour. if lucky 23 I got submitted my resume to apply for the job and got an email out of the blue to be prepare with in an hour or two for an interview. they didn't called next day I got the call a lady asking me if I was still interested in the job and I reply yes she said your manager will send you all the information and details. I ask is there a way to communicate face to face. she said we only communicated through email or text.I asked how does a customer communicate with the company because I tried many time calling your company but there's never a connection. She said not to worry I would not have to dance with anyone. she explain that for the trail period I would have to use my bank account to release some money in order to do payments for various customers (they would deposit the money and I would manage it for the trial period) after that a corporate account would be assigned to me. I never had a proper interview she didn't care about my qualifications or past experience. After the call I got an email with requests for banking information and a labour agreement. I was desperate and reach out to a new professor at school and she confirmed my suspicion. I hope your can review and confirm my doubts. at this point I don't want my name or identity be taken because of a scar.
and a Job offer for Executive Assistant without so much as a telephone interview. Claimed to see my value off resume alone. Full time $27 to start and $34 after 30 day operation.   Requested a reply accepting offer to hiring@intercae.ca. Email gave a number to call for any questions, but the email was not closed with a persons name, rather "Home Department" no personal information was requested at this time. When I called the number a woman stating her name was being answered.  I asked her straight away if this offer was legitimate.  She told me there is an organization that assists schools with exchange students.  She told me the Edmonton office was opening in May, they are looking for office space. She asked if I had replied to the email - I said I had I was then told that in the interim I would be starting by doing work via the internet, until the office is up and running. And that id get a call in the next 2-3 business days to sort everything out. This whole thing felt funny to me.  If you use them - they are nonstop on the web.  The link for the website- takes you to a website that says "under construction" but gives the number from the email as a contact number.  I find this very hard to believe to be a real organization now, as if schools were indeed using them, there would be some record of them somewhere. They Claim to work with these "VALUED PARTNERS": Air Canada, Destination Canada,  And who they call "Aboriginal Tourism Association of Canada" but if you choose that organization, you are directed to Indigenous Tourism Canada, which uses the same logo as on the valued partners portion of the same website.  So perhaps they are utilizing them without consent as well.  NONE of these listed VALUED PARTNERS have any reference to INTER CAE on their websites. I am grateful I did some homework, but I was initially very excited to be offered such a "too good to be true" position.  I have been without work for 7 months and I  believe they were trying to take advantage of me at my most vulnerable.
A person named Sheri Li has posted job opportunities under the company name: "Tommy Hilfiger - Recruiting Department"  on the "Careers" job board at Camosun College. She posted twice (Feb. and Mar. 2018) under the job title 'Store Clerk.' A student who engaged with this fake employer was asked to deposit a $700 check in their personal bank account, cash it, then meet someone claiming to be from the company, to give them the cash as a business transaction. The deposited checks then bounced and the student was on the hook for the money missing from their bank account. I'm                                                                        and the student delivered this message to me. I encouraged them to contact the police.

A representative by the name of Cathy Beeker sent an email with a work from home job offer (one that I never applied to) that sounded way to good to be true. There was no interview and they wanted to hire me out. The contact number listed was never answered and the call was automated. After accepting the job, they requested that I create a bank account. They sent me a check to use for supplies I would need to work from home, the check was fraud and I was held responsible for it with my bank.
Don't mention the company name a and just kept stating that the are a A rated BBB member. Maybe it's not a concern but you wouldn't it shouldn't A rate a company that looks for employees like me this.
I was very excited to work with the company icon destinations by darn international. There was an apprenticeship that lasted for 3 months no paid at all. but with the promise of payment based in percentage of sales of travel packages, iconic events, or national concerts of small artists. I ended up staying 6 months with more promises every month that were never put in place. I was involved as social media manager and for the is reason the work I do is not specifically at the office. I work on line so I did go to the office just for meetings and special occasions.  And I know about online traffic and traffic on the pages and saw tragic on them but  he said he never sold any tickets for the specific events and asked me to promote the Facebook page and Twitter account but one payment went wrong on the bosses credit card and it did not go through. After a few days I was taken out of the administration account for icon destination and dab international LinkedIn to my personal Facebook account. And there was an unpaid bill. When I asked for the money to Rui Da Silva (the employer) he refused to pay. I've killed him, I've been to the office, I went to an office in the USA but it is s fake.

I was hired by this company for approx 2 weeks.i told them I could start but I would need help getting my tools there they told me no problem.everyday they put it off finally I got my tools there on my own.but the next 3 days were the beginning of the end when I could pay in the form of checks that I couldn't cash.this was at the end of the day when banks were closed.till the next day and didn't have the funds to get to work that was a friday.between then and today I was locked out of the business which keeps its doors locked so anyone can't just walk in. The one partner left out of province the other only tells me by text to be there at a certain time in the am and I did so waited at nearby coffee shop to answer text which finally got inserted the next day. And they proceeded to tell me that I was fired in which the didn't pay me on the spot made me wait until the 15 the and for both pays there was no response.the second pay was in the form of cash after taking a pension off me of 25.00 a day so that was 150.00 in total and my wage was never paid from the beginning.so basically there reason for letting me go was always late but they wouldn't let me in or they weren't there because I was waiting for them.and no show.then to top it all off my tool box was broken into and many items taken and others I wasn't able to recover because I was met with hostility over a argument bout these issues in text and that's what happened in my experience there.I've been in the trade of Autobody 30 and I've never been treated like that ever.
They offered me a job opportunity as a order processing officer for them. After consulting my local law enforcement I was advised they are running a.

At this point I can not say I have been pleased. It falls under the category of too good to be true.  An email offering work from home for $27.50 per hour as a financial manager in logistics.  I have no experience or qualifications for this job.  At first only requesting  basic info by filling out a job application with references including most recent employer.  I just recently quit my job.  I filled out the application and replied.  Within hours I got a reply saying I have been approved for the position.  Now they are requesting Passport details and bank info along with legitimate looking things like a labour  and construction agreement.  They have a website that looks legitimate and the website says they were incorporated in 2012, and lists a phone number. I tried searching the word # on the government website but it did not show any matches.  I called the company phone number and it rang busy continuously.  I searched on the new website and got no matches for this company. On street view the company address given is just a house with a yard across from a park on Argyle St in Vancouver.
I was trained by Ross Wright.  Who offered a job description of a position as he was aware I was looking for a job probably due to LinkedIn. The job left right up my alley as a payment manager in down operations I gave my personal information including my address and driver's license and banking information because they said that I was approved and sent me a letter of offer remember they said they would call me today at 3 p.m. and didn't and said that they would call me again tomorrow at 9 a.m. which I'm sure they probably 'n't as well. I'm scared that they took my information to actually use it for identity theft. What do I do?
Basically, I received an email from  our, Mark inson, who apparently found my email address on kijiji.ca. I assumed probably he found it from the ad that I had posted there, but it was still confusing. Anyway, he was all like , $400/assignment.  and obviously I got interested. But my boyfriend sensed it was a trap, but we played along anyway. The only information he asked for was my home address, my name and my age. So I'm like businesses don't ask for age, they ask for date of birth. And the email was probably typed by a 10 year old because there was too many small mistakes. Again, the response followed was from a different email address. And it had asked me to confirm my information before they tell me about my first task. I work as a Western Union agent at my work place so I know all about Western Union trains. So when the first assignment arrived at my lab, there it was: a letter from the so-called  New Project Evaluation Team,  and a  large Team also  worth $2,950.00 USD. The letter mentioned that I was supposed to cash the check at a bank, then keep $400 for myself, spend $25 at home, and with the remaining balance, I was supposed to send $1200 each to 2 different people in Paris, who all have the same ZIP code, from 2 different western unions. And then I was supposed to send an evaluation to: evaluation-reportcenter@accountant.com. Like the letter has too many mistakes on it. The envelope that the letter came in had a postal stamp and the address and name was hand-written. Just thought I you d let you know so that someone like these people can stop hurting people.
The individual posts ads on online freelance websites, to be honest I don't remember how I found him as it's been awhile. It might have been Freelancer.com or Guru.com. The ad claims you just have to write some short reviews to make some money. When I was "hired" I was sent money via Paypal (all transactions were done through PP) in amounts of $20 dollars then sent a link to a freelance gig on Fiverr.com and Tictail.com, one of the gigs I was repeatedly asked to buy was this one: https://tictail.com/virtualassistant/i-will-be-your-private-detective-spy and this one https://tictail.com/virtualassistant/fiverr-sales-formula, and some others from stores that are "still" open now. They would send me enough money to purchase it, then I would leave a positive review, then they would send me $10 via Paypal. The names of the letters were random, never from the email of the person I was talking to. I did this for about a month or more, then suddenly all the payments that were send to me were being disputed by the bank. And I had no way of arguing really the dispute, so the it would close in their favor, they'd get their money back. Eventually the money got returned and now my Paypal account is in a negative balance and I can't even access it anymore. I've called "Sam", or whatever his name is as his typing leads me to believe English isn't his first language, repeatedly asking for the money back to at least return my PP account to good standing. And he says he'll pay me back but never does. I was free, and so were all the people sending the money to me. At least they got their money back.
I have been applying at jobs recently as I am moving, so when I received the email from this company, I thought it was one of the many that I had applied at. The job sounded good, almost too good to be true, then I had told them I would work part time, and then everything started getting weird. They said I would need to be available all day for a call, and then leave my office for the task they were going to give me. Immediately I was uncomfortable, and I asked them to specify. No response, I was very uncomfortable and still have not gotten a response. I told them via email I want nothing to do with the company and that I am reporting the business as a fraud. Still no response to make me believe otherwise.
I was contacted by this company and i was told that they found me through indeed. They offered me a job and i spoke to her and another woman on the phone at some point. Majority of our interaction is through email or a mobile app called Facebook. They offer $25 an hour. I cannot find anything about this company in me besides another individual asking the same questions i am regarding this "job opportunity" they havenot asked me for any personal information besides my direct deposit details. They have a website but i am still not sure what to think of this situation. They assigned me a project asking me to do a presentation about my city in a format. They also gave me a run down of things in and out expectations.. they said they are located in City, and they are soon opening a location in my city which is exactly what the other individual stated when i read their forum in person. The location of the other individual is unknown.
I was contacted because my resume was found through a job application site. They offered a high salary of 1340 (€) a week, promising I would be paid weekly and I could work remotely. I fold them and one lists an address in Rexdale. Score, right? As I went through the process they offered me a legal-sounding contract, promised a 10 day trial period in which they would judge my work, and then wanted to e-transfer money to my bank account so that I could then put it in a pocket wallet. A legitimate company is never going ask you to use your personal account for money transfers, and they could just as easily put the money in a private wallet themselves. The money transfer was the proof I needed that the company wasn't on the up-and-up but there were details here that made me suspicious: They sent detailed, well-written emails and had a nicely put together website that used a lot of words but wasn't clear about their services. None of the people listed as working at the company on their website were visible on social media which is strange and neither was the woman I was talking to. The date their company was founded when you look up their Corp. number (10522988) on can1business.com does not match with how long they say they have been in business on their website. On their website they listed articles that supposedly praised them as the top marketing firm in X year. I couldn't find those articles anywhere. Frankly, the benefits were too good to be true.
I have noticed other puzzled people on chat rooms that have had the same offer and are wondering if this is a trap.  IT CERTAINLY IS!! I applied for this job through Indeed.ca... which in my ignorance thought that all companies listed there were illegal.  that's on me feel a little foolish but I had to pursue this to it's end so others 'n't be shocked by this just to confirm you email address. 18 days ago I was applying for jobs in desperation I applied for this position on indeed.ca  it looks great until you pay back some of the layers. I called the number... "He" will answer on a very early cell phone reception. Soon after I had responded to "Kelly Baker" - obviously fake name  that I was going to report this to my local police chief. if I did not hear from her within 24 hours.   No response at all.

I responded to a part time job ad on it and when the person (Douglas Webb) responded to me he explained that the job was to post sponsored job ads on the website indeed.ca.  He explained that the pay would be $   /week or $   /bi-weekly or $$     /monthly and to let him know how I would like to be paid and that I had the option of money order or certified credit.  He then explained they would provide me with an email address to create under it, as I would need this address to register and create a log into the site indeed.ca.  He asked me to provide my name, email address, phone number for payment.  He said after creating this account with indeed.ca, he would send me a detailed directory needed for the posting, and that I would need to do these posts 2-3 times per week.  I asked if the pay had any exemption (tax), and if there would be a tax?  He replied that the tax was taken care of and that the money was all mine.  When I chose to be paid weekly by certified people, he then said they would be sending me a certified check in the amount of $    .  He said they were sending me extra money as I needed to use this money to purchase the gift cards and that this money also included weekly pay.  He asked me to purchase the gift cards from a place near me but to provide the address of the Wal Mart to him that I would be purchasing them from.  I tried to call the number provided under his name a few times, but got nowhere each time. I said I would prefer to speak to someone directly about all of this and wanted him to phone me.  I then asked further questions on email, like how much of this was to be spent on the cards, and how much was weekly pay, and mentioned that something seemed "off" about this being legitimate.  I said you are trusting me to send me $   ?  How do you know I will do what you ask? This was the latest email I got back from him (note the weekly wage changed to $   /week  and the posting site change to Kijiji and now he is asking me to purchase the new cards before I receive payment, saying I will be paid): Thanks for getting back to us with the Wal Mart address as requested. Be rest assured this is 100% clear and you have no cause for alarm. Also You can get the business cards purchased. You are just to purchase like $     worth of the card and it is only for this time. You will be receiving your weekly wages of $    steadily. We will let you know when to receive the payment and the instructions needed to process the credit card.While waiting for the payment to arrive, we would like you to post on it. There will be a compensation for this as well. Let us know if this is OK by you so that we can send you the directory needed. We will accept your reply and in respect to this. I replied and said I would not be using any of my own money to purchase anything and said this felt like a way to get me to purchase the gift cards (as as he explains this $     purchase was a one time purchase - of course it is!  Cause then I would realize it was a dream!).  I also pointed out to him that he changed the wage amount and posting site to it (from Indeed.ca).
Contacted over LinkedIn to become an agent for them to collect payments from their clients. a $5000 fee a month salary and 5% additional commission for each successful transaction was offered.  They wanted my resume, SIN, bank information and account number to setup my direct deposit payments.  Seems fake as their website was only in English and it was supposed to be a Japanese company.
While job searching I was called and called about a job for administration for a new office opening in Edmonton.  They called and had what they called a short interview.  About a week later they called and said I got the job and if I want it they will send some documents via email.  But then they said they will send a check to get office supplies so when that was sent I stopped contact but they still sent a check.  The company on the phone was Newton Group and they said they weren't apart of it and the bank was in credit union  and they said it was a fake.  I have not contacted them or told them I received the letter.
I was contacted sight-unseen with a 'job offer' by Alice Williams of Diamond Staffing Solutions Ltd. in Vancouver, BC looking for a full-time, and a part-time Human Resources Specialist to work in their new office opening in Edmonton, Alberta.  The e-mail said (among other things), "We have studied your resume and came to the conclusion that you will suit for this role."  If you were to read my resume, you would know that I am not qualified for this position as I don't have the needed education for anything more than a clinical assistant in this particular field.  I will convert the job description they sent me to you, and attach it.  The salary being offered for the full-time position is $5000.00 per month, but the 10 day paid probation term only pays $700.00 total (which is below the minimum wage here in Alberta).  In all of the e-games she uses linguistic errors common to non-native speakers.  My guess (having studied linguistics in school, and having a lot of exposure to immigrants having lived most of my life in Vancouver) is that she is from somewhere in SE Asia or from the Indian Sub-Continent.  The second e-mail followed the first very quickly (just over 2 hours later), and sounds more desperate for a quick reply.  The third asks me, "If you want me to erase yours address from our waiting list, please let me know."  The fourth e-mail says, "I am going to erase your name from the waiting list and remove your name from the list of job candidate."  I still have all four of the e-mail she sent me, and would be happy to forward them to you if desired. I suspect she must've posted a legitimate-looking job offer using a different (legitimate) company name on Linked In, which I applied to so that she could get my contact information.  I haven't used this contact information on indeed.ca, which I have used in the past, otherwise I'd wonder how she had come to have my new 'for job hunting only' e-mail address that I have only recently started using.  I had similar things happen in the past with indeed.ca.  The biggest difference is that Diamond Staffing Solutions has a website which features an address and telephone numbers, and it shows up on a web search.  The website almost looks legitimate, except for the poorly-executed logo. Sad to say, I have not replied to any of her e-mail, so I don't know what information or anything else she would have asked of me.  As it stands, she has my first and last name, job search e-mail address, and possibly my cell number. In any case, I'd appreciate your feedback, and any advice as to how to proceed.  I will definitely block her e-mail address in the near future unless you or legal authorities advise differently. PS:  The e-mail I will provide below is my personal e-mail, not my job search e-mail.
A Joanna Wilson from M  and  C International Corp responded to a transfer position I applied through indeed job board. She responded through indeed asking me to confirm my name, email address and phone number. I confirmed and received an email in email from a Joanna Wilson a day later stating that with the information I have provided, I would make a good candidate. She gave a brief job description that had a base hourly wage of $17/hour + additional money per transaction. The job description was to do inventory and transfer micro-currency into bank's, exchange real money for micro-currency, manage all the accounts and services. I and M  and  C International Corp and it's unrelated to the job description. It is an IT Company. I went back on indeed to the messages section to find the posting, clicked on it and it said the job cannot be found. Attached to the end of her email was "via message." Googles that and it seems like its way. Hope this helps!

I was contacted by one of the Linkedin that the company Gradco Ltd. was looking  for a representative, I did applied and when I was accepted the job, the person name Erik Shen instructed me to collect payment from their customer and instructed that the payment should be made again under my name. My husband alerted me telling me that this is a trap, I sent the letter back to the customer as I refused to accept and deposit the check. I have informed Gradco that I am not comfortable accepting the payment under my name. However, the mail keep returning back to me, today I went to the post office and return back the package.
This is how the company came at me when I didn't apply for them or contact them. I offer you a position in the company... We need staff in your area to fill vacant positions in your location. After sending all necessary documents, I will arrange a telephone interview with an operator of the company. Every employee will have the paid probation, after interview. It will help you to learn job basis. After your probation you will be invited in our new company's representative office in your location. It will open soon. You could choose a type of employment full day in office or part-time. Ever since this first initial message I have on going back  and  forth conversations. I had a representative reach out to me whom I could not formally understand the language. Then I reached out to Chrstine stating I couldn't understand them, got no response only a email saying I needed the job! The interview was not like a normal interview. It was just a bunch of words with partially understood words. I was then told to do a task which I had done and then I received a message stating I completed the task and it goes on.
This is a copy of the email they sent me. I sent them an email asking more about their company, like how long it had been in business and some other questions. The lady said that if I filled out the form she would call me the next day. I filled out the form(it had nothing on it but address and place of business that I currently worked). Then she sent me an email stating I had the position and that all I needed to do was fill out the final forms to make the offer of employment. I have not filled out these forms as they are asking for banking information as well as my SIN number. The address on the website is not at all accurate. They stated that they would be opening up a new location in my area and that is not true. I tried calling the numbers given and there is no answer. Hello ------, Calypso National Travel wants you!

I received an email from "Tom Parker" that told me I would be perfect for a role at The HR Agency Inc. I was never told what the job involved but that I had been selected out of numerous rum sum and s. After some digging, the person told me it would be an HR Specialist, which I have NO experience in. They also claimed I would be making up to $2200 and work from home. I never once had an interview. I initially ignored the email multiple times, but this person would email me everyday, wondering if I was interested. She finally called me after I didn't reply, telling me she was removing my name from her candidate list. 2 days later however, I received another email from her, acting like nothing happened and still asking if I wanted the job.
The email came out of the blue. While I was looking at employment on Indeed.com the employer here I couldn't find the confirmation email that would have been sent to me stating i applied for such a job. This was a red flag right away. The emails sent to me were copy-based and exactly like a previous employment record that was reported.

I have all the e-mail information plus a $4,250 check from the owner.  Brian Hill
I was reported on indeed.ca, and offered a job working from home for this company, allegedly founded in 2008. One of 5 positions were available, both full- (40s) and part-time (20 hours) with 3 weeks free vacation time. I said I was interested in the 10-day trial period, and in reply, the letter of offer stated  25 days of vacation, and the job duties changed to include the transactions to purchase domains. Nowhere was I personally identified as the recipient of this offer, and due to the high number of people in my trial period, I would only be able to communicate via e-mail (no phone #). Replies came at all hours of the day, and the interaction started slowly, which I found odd. Their website doesn't have a year beside their copyright (c) info, and their social media links take you to the respective home pages of the services, not anything affiliated with this company.
Dear Applicant,. We at Wanix Uk And pleased to confirm offer you the position of Online Data Entry for game server with reference to your application received by email this week, your starting salary will be $750/= per Week,. You will be paid weekly (daily) on the last working day of each week... First salary you can claim in advance after 2nd day of completed work submission
This lady named Caroline Dias uses Indeed.ca to find people, and offers people to work at a huge rate of pay, plus many promises such as increases, benefits and more. She claims in an anonymous email that EE Intercultural Affairs is opening an office "in your city" and is replacing it with staff ahead of time. The opportunity is work-from-home at first. Duties are to create PowerPoint presentations about the area to ostensibly be shown to foreign students. There is no face-to-face interview or meeting with anyone. I got the job in 2 days, and my references were not called. When I pressed for executive tier and revenue stream information, she didn't answer my Telegram texts and claimed their internet connection went down. After more digging, I found out from him that this is a day but unfortunately not before I worked 60 hours, on top of my regular job.  Stay clear of CAROLINE DIAS AND EE INTERCULTURAL AFFAIRS.
I applied for and Administrative Assistant position through indeed.ca and received an email.  The email provided the details of the position and asked if I was still interested in the job.  I replied yes, they sent me documents to complete to do a "security check".  They explained they are an international company for international exchange students and I would be helping to set the students up for graduation and provide general office duties.  The list of duties provided sounded normal.  They stated the office in London, Ontario was not open yet, it was scheduled to open in March 2018.  I would be expected to work remotely (from home) until the office opened.  I accepted the position and signed the documents.  I was instructed to sign onto an app called Pandora.  This would ensure I my hours were tracked.  I started to work on till, 9th 2018, I received my first project.  I was to create a PowerPoint presentation about London, Ontario.  The due date was Thurs Feb 14, 2018 at 5pm.  I competed the project on time and was told it was really good and they were happy with my work. The next day I received a new project.  I was to research options for university students coming to London, Ontario and staying for the summer months.  The due date was for Friday May 16, 2018 at 5pm.  On Friday I received a telephone message asking me to setup payment for accommodation for a group of students coming to Halifax NS and then to Ontario next week.  At this point I was suspicious.  So I asked a whole bunch of questions as to why they couldn't pay through the company account or credit card and why would they ask a new person to be handling money.  After I started to ask questions, the person stopped talking on Telegram.  So I finished my project and handed it in at random.  I was told we would be working on Family Day, so I signed into Telegram this morning and Doris Holinaty is not online.  So I called her number, it is disconnected, as is another number used to call me.
Skye Hawkins gets jobs in construction and contracts you out at a higher rate as a paid worker like an employment agency such as Labour Unlimited only he doesn't do this up front, nor did he provide a licence number as a registered employment agency.  He did not pay me as agreed, nor on time, nor completely.  Also, the business name contains the suffix "s" and yet BC Registry Service has NO information about them.  Their official employment ad reads:  We currently are seeking small car owners operators that can provide  Clean crime pass  Clean drivers abstract.  Insurance companies.  If you can provide these we have small package and mail service called  ready to be held march 03 onward  These can be applied to  Steam punks@yahoo.com  Partial requirement is to have our eyes on your head.  https://www.usedvictoria.com/classified-ad/steam-punks-systems-corp- 28984674
I was contacted via email by a Bob Faust, he stated they got my email from Indeed. They stated the following: "Good morning. Thank you we've got your resume on Job site Indeed.com. We will review your resume during the day. Please reply on this email if you are still looking for a job, I will give you more information regarding the company and available position." After my reply stating i was looking for employment they gave me some more info. " We conduct our operations and continue the development in the field of Human Resources.Recently, we have expanded our staff and we are planning to open new offices in 4 cities of Canada. We would like to offer you a position of Human Resource Specialist. We have studied your resume and came to the conclusion that you will suit for this role." The company seem famous as they provided a website with information. They then proceed to offer me a contract that seem real in where i is accepted and sign. (by the way they request a picture of a face with the signature of the contract). The next step was a phone "Interview" a lady name Kate called me, that was my first suspicion. Kate seem like she was reading a of a paper, i could barely understand her and she didn't really ask me anything but stated the job offering from the email and and said i was hired. She asked me to email Bob and send him a date and time to begin my "probation/Training" which would be a duration of 10 days. I later got an email From Bob Fauser stating the following: "Our operator told me that you had interviewed. I am pleased to inform you that you have passed the most difficult stage of our employment. Congratulations! I'm very happy for you. I have always believed and knew that you will be in our team! As the operator told me, you are a very intelligent and sensible person." I found it funny that the "operator" stated that as we were barely on the phone for 5 minutes and i did not really speak. I decided to continue as i did not want to be rude. and, then gave me my first task (which seem great) i had to create a Job Ad on indeed, all was good till then. I was actually happy and excited to be doing work like that and from home! Reality sank in when he gave me my second task. He stated that the company used Bitcoin and proceed to tell me the following: "I'll give you one more account of our company. And I'll teach you how to use it. Of course, you will need some Bitcoins. We will provide you with funds for this reason. I'll help you buy Bitcoins. We need to be able to transfer money to you so that you can buy it for work. Popular methods of bank transfers: 1. Transfer to a credit card by card number. 2. The e-transfer." Red Flag! I was not comfortable and did not think it was right to be using my bank account for work purposes especially on my first day of "training" I called Bod and stated i was not comfortable doing that and i did not want it to be a joke, he did not acknowledge that comment but simply stated that during my trail i had to use my bank account. I took a while to respond and twice he asked me if i was there and to keep in touch. I did some investigating and called the building where their office is supposed to be, according to their website and i was notified that they don't have an office there and they've had complaints about "The Halifax Staffing Inc" using their building address. I then proceeded to email you the Following: "Unfortunately i 'n't be able to continue with the training. I apologize but i am not comfortable with this type of employment. Please remove me from your Database." This was his reply: "Ok, thank you." I am glad i did not provide my banking information however, i am upset they have my personal information and a picture. Hope they don't use it.  Be AWARE! Don't provide any personal information until you confirm they are a new company. I hate people taking advantage of good people looking for employment. Attach you can see the Job description with incredible wages.
Helena is advertising she can make you rich and only have to work an hour a day, I requested info however she would not explain how or what I would be doing to make all this money, so she informed me to watch videos that her leaders made so I did however all they spoke about was how rich they are. So i asked her again in 8 more emails and she refused to tell me until. I pay 100 bucks I told her i needed to know more she wrote me back saying I will never be a business owner like her because fear was holding me back she said its only a 100 bucks just pay it and then your on the inside and we will tell you how it works!! I found her very rude, her web site andgon marketing is fill with quotes and a false image of being rich. Which is like people who is looking for work at home jobs. I want to help innocent good people from losing money to innocent people.

They offered me a job that was supposed to pay 870 a week after seeing my resume on indeed. I sent in an application but something didn't feel right so I looked into it. It was all a dream. You even had to use your personal banking information to interact with customers. Luckily, I didn't give them that information.
Employer hired my daughter, paid her cash daily, plus 1 gram of marijuana, left her with his dog on premises to watch, then abruptly fired her with accusation he was 'cleaned out' and believes her former friend was responsible. During her time working for him he was observed trading marijuana for food, people coming and being allowed in to the area where all money and marijuana are kept, rolling marijuana and smoking it. There are many back rooms she was not permitted in. This business is'small' with the feeling it is a 'front'for something else. There will also be a police report made regarding this.
they wanted to hire without an interview for an operation manager. Said i was their top candidate. as the first task they wanted me to but declined and said they would transfer money into my account. They wanted me to provide a credit card number so they could transfer the cash. they made the initial contact via email through Twitter and then ask you to download a personal app called Steam, where they continue to have a conversation with you.
It started with a job posting on Indeed by a company called Basinview Consulting for a Cashier position. Basinview Consulting then asked me to obtain my contact information for further instructions and mentioned that the position was for their client, Dahlgren Software Consulting. They also sent me the position details written on a word document stating that the job is to convert money into real currency by withdrawing money and putting it into a real currency ATM. At first I was in disbelief as the job paid $17/hour and home-based, but with new technology products coming out I didn't want to question it too soon. She sent me an application form, also on word document, that included me having to list only 2 references. She then handed my information to Dahlgren Software Consulting (Ashley Baumann), who sent me an email the next day to ask if they can make an anonymous phone call. Upon speaking with her, she welcomed me to the company and said that she will follow up with more emails regarding training and training period. I asked her what the training would take, she told me to just wait for the email. I asked her to tell me more about the company, she told me that everything I needed to know was on the website. There was no information regarding their age, other employees, etc when I joined the company. I also looked up the address from their website and when I clicked Street View, it showed a house. After the phone call, she sent me a form and email stating that the training agreement should be filled and signed before training will be held. In the form, it asks for E-transfer information as well as Credit Card information, which no job has any business in asking for. I was therefore  also hired out  without any interview, without a credit check or a criminal check, which is what you say d expect from a job where you are required to withdraw and deposit money that you s outside of company grounds. No money was taken from me, I declined the position right after.

I was contacted by an consulting with a employment opportunity that sounds to good to be true. I require to make money deposits into my own account and send the money back to the company in quick time limit.
I applied via Indeed Website on a summer job (work remotely) for the company Basinview Consulting. They responded back through email and suggested that I will be contacted by a different person from the company Dahlgren Software Consulting. I find them suspicious when the job posting was removed from all the job sites right away  and  the lady who responded to me doesn't have a contact/phone number. The job requires receiving money online, withdrawing cash from specific banks and buying certain currency. One of the 3 files they attached on their e-mail was company  and  job description and includes a link marked as www.dahlgrensoftware.com (funny thing is when you click it - it connects to http://www.dilsnertechnology.com/ which site cannot be reached but for dilsnertechnology shows to be a site used for lots of internet sites).

This lady named Caroline Dias uses Indeed.ca to find people, and offers people to work at a huge rate of pay, plus many promises such as increases, benefits and more. She claims in an anonymous email that EEIntercultural Affairs is opening an office "in your city" and is replacing it with staff ahead of time. The opportunity is work-from-home at first. Duties are to create PowerPoint presentations about the area to ostensibly  be shown to foreign students. There is no face-to-face interview or meeting with anyone. I got the job in 3 days, and my references were not called. I investigated her phone number which GPS'd to Vancouver, not Winnipeg. When I pressed for executive tier and revenue  stream information, she didn't answer my Telegram texts and claimed their internet connection went down. After more digging, I found out from her that this is a year before she tried to make money through me. Her trick is to e-transfer $3000 to your email address that you are asked to take to a local contact of her choosing, less $100 for your expenses. Then she calls  your bank and tells them you tried to call her, which will cause your bank to place a hold on your account. I found out about her before she  got that far, and all I lost was a week's pay from my former situation. You should always be wary if there is no interview, and requests for banking information. Stay clear of CAROLINE DIAS AND EE INTERCULTURAL AFFAIRS.
I applied on job ad on indeed as customer service manager. Some one called me from New York called Arlie (business development manager) but I couldn't pick up the phone. So he sent me an email (came to my junk ) that I am accepted and I have to sign the job offer and a form which was asking for email to send money by e transfer. I did that and send them back to him. The day after, I received an email from my supposed manager (James Evans) that I have to be the person who will contact customers and contractors to deposit money from them and pay money to others using my bank account. I didn't feel comfortable with that and send them that NO and I declined the job. Here's the email content: There is the payment processing algorithm: 1. A client transfers money via Internet e-Transfer. We choose this method as of the highest security. All payments bear your fee of 5%. You will get your commission rewards for each transaction. For matching funds, you will get a secret question and its answer. In order to deposit a processed transaction, you are entitled to apply online banking systems using them from any device (laptop / tablet / phone). 2. Having finished reading, you will be enabled to withdraw your funds through your bank office. We recommend you to avoid withdrawing money through banks as they usually have withdrawal limits ($500), which may slow down the transaction processing. 3. Here, let me tell you how to process payments to our contractors quickly and accurately. When accomplished the Step 2, please find the nearest Bitcoin ATM to process the transaction to our contractors' email account. Why Bitcoin? We use it due to several significant reasons: 1. it is highly safe and secure. Among all online banking systems, this account shows the greatest security level. 2. This operation processing is truly fast. Making bank transfers, you generally have to have transactions pending for a few days - especially when you submit a check payment from another bank into yours, and the bank holds funds for verification. International transactions are also a time problem. This way, Bitcoin is much more efficient. 3. Your fees are extremely low, and sometimes you may get no commission at all. a) The closest Bitcoin ATM is here: 216 Saddletowne in NEW, ABV, Canada (Bitcoin ATM is located at Macy's Convenience Store in Calgary.) b) Please be guided by this video for processing Bitcoin ATM operations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9-xP2CBWj0 c) Open the C-code attached to this message as an image. This is the unique ID for your payment. Please save it to the media library of your cell phone in advance. 4. The transaction shall be processed within no longer than 3 hours. This rate is highly volatile related to CAD, USB and others. Therefore, the transaction shall be accomplished within the abovementioned time period.
"   Fraud Company Blueline Soft or theT both are one company,  donot be a victim like me, i wasted my time with this poor,unprofessional staff,they will block numbers and "not respond emails" they cheated me, i paid them 600$ of no use, they donot have offices in US, they work from India.. cheap labor. they use fake numbers and fakes.
I had the same experience as this report sent in May 24, 2018  but June 29 2018 asked me about a position at Tauton Services. Name was Jessica Carter. She gave me a description of the job (IT Services Manager) which sounded good from the beginning. I asked about the pay and gave me an "incredible" number that seemed too good to be true.  I did a search in London and the company name never came up. I sent an email back saying that I am aware of the case and am reporting it.
 Contact through Indeed, offering jobs. I'm not sure where to share this info, so I placed here where other people can receive searched data. No more search data on company.... First contact: Spectrum Protect https://www.spectrprotect.com/ career@spectrprotect.com Google at least knows the website of the second. Second contact: Present Business presentbusiness.org career@presentbusiness.org Both web sites have the same info. I believe this is a scheme targeted at people looking for employment that will lead to a traditional cash transfer with money and personal bank accounts. When going back through Indeed the sites fall back to https://www.kepro.com/.  I suspect that this company is real but did not research further as now this has become a waste of my time. 
I was contacted by this business informing me that my resume fit the needs of their position opening, and that they were offering me a job. After doing research, two of the names of the management team -- Robert Morin and Michael Fincham -- appeared in another BBB search for Bennecon Ltd. as being an employment firm. It appears that they have used the same names to run multiple games.
This man contacted me offering a job and attached a job agreement and form to fill out, trying to get my personal information and signature. They provided a fake website, with fake contact information and a fake work address. If you call the building of the location provided, they will tell you there is no suite 128 and that it is a suite (many people have called them asking the same thing)
Told me about a position at Tauton Services.  Name was Jessica  Carter.  She gave me a description of the job (IT Services Manager) which sounded good from the beginning.  I asked about the pay and gave me an "incredible" number that seemed too good to be true.  I asked twice about benefits.  Never replied back in response to benefits but sent me forms to fill out and pushed me to sign quickly and accept the agreement.  I did a search and the company name never came up.  I called the building she was their head office and the owner told me he had never heard of  her or the company.  I sent an email back saying that I am aware of the case and am reporting it.  Haven't heard back since.
Currently out of work I spend a lot of time on Indeed. I received the org. Email from a Sarah Thompson stating they received my resume and asked that I fill in their employee application which was very basic, from there I then received an email again from Sarah Thompson asking if I can do a phone interview when I wasn't available at the time they asked I then received an  email offer also  from the manager Andy Smith within this offer I is m asked to provide various information from my bank account info to sending over copies of my identity as well as taking funds for the company during a 5 day trail period into my account I haven u t replied to this email as of yet.
attached there is an email I received from them, after this i got a call from someone and I couldn't understand what she said and she hang up, I tried to call back but just send me straight to him. minutes later they send me another email saying that they want me on the process and that I should fill up a contract agreement and send a copy of my driver licence which I was stupid enough to fill up.now I just hope they don't steel my identity to get credit cards. Sarah Thompson - Dahlgren Software Consulting Inc. Mon 1/22/2018, 12:56 PM You ? Dear             , Thank you for your filling in an "Application Form". We were impressed by your background and would like to invite you to our phone call to tell you a little more about the position and get to know you better.

Looking forward to hearing from you, Yours Sincerely, Sarah Thompson, Manager
-- The Management of ENSIVAL MORET, is greatly in need of an individual who can handle its  account decisions from its customers/clients in Canada or in the United States... Forward your resume to the Human Resource Manager, Mr.  Armand Sohet with the contact information below: E-mail: from ensivalmoret@gmx.com Tele: +32 (78) 487-550 Bois la Dame 1, 4890 Thimister-Clermont, Belgium www.ensival-moret.com
I was contacted randomly by an individual claiming to have found my resume from a certain job website which seemed legitimate. I was offered the position without any interviews (not even any questions via email). In doing some more research into the company's address, it turned out to be a residential address in Google Maps (check street view). There is also no phone number that I can find on their website.
I had gotten an email for an employment opportunity however I was asked to complete direct deposit information before even getting an interview which to me seemed a little too weird.
I received the job offer from me which I think looks fake.
the White family is only a small part of a huge pyramid scheme.  I can't believe I was stupid enough to fall for this, except it makes perfect sense and you can actually make money from it...if you're willing to trap other people into putting their money into the system..the people above the family are called the family and the people above that, well, now you're getting into the big smoothies..  or network..etc.. so what happens is, you put in some money, and obviously, the more you put in, the more'money making secrets' they 'unlock' for you so i went whole lot, put in $5000 up front..you have to spend money to make money right??  and they give you the choice, which is that you have to get the maximum number of people to even look at your face to get the minimum number to even sign up...it's really hard to get people to look at your stuff, you have to have a hook...but you can buy these packages where these other, similar companies, get tons of eyes on your stuff, but it's expensive and it doesn't always work... example, you might spend $300 for 300 'guaranteed' eyes on your site and MAYBE one of those people sign up... then, you can also buy'super great tips' from someone else in the business but they're selling their 'tips' to everyone so we're all doing the same thing and no one is winning, except for the guys at the top..  and they'll tell you that technically they're not a pyramid scheme because they technically have a product for sale(some ridiculous e-books on marketing) but the product is just more vague stuff about nothing and just them saying a lot of words to pump you up about making sales but not really telling you how to do anything. They send you emails constantly, showing them living their luxurious lifestyle but the truth is, they move to countries like Russia because it's cheaper to live down there and there's probably some legal/illegal reasons too but i don't know those.  If you make 1 sale, you get excited and think that's the beginning of something big so you hang in there and spend more and more money, but if you're not a thief, you 'n't succeed.  i spent $20000 trying to start an above board online business so i could spend more time with my family, my aging parents...etc.  Instead of succeeding, i now have a second and third job to pay off my debt, because it wasn't above board, it's cheap and people can smell that from a mile away and don't want to sign up.   My mom died while I was working to pay off all this extra debt and I spent less time with her instead of more.  These people are farmers.  And they tell you straight out in their videos(the guys at the top), that they've been shut down before and they just keep starting up again because 'THE MAN CAN'T KEEP US DOWN!'  Am i angry and bitter that it didn't work for me?  of course i am.  would i still be doing it if it had worked?  i don't know, maybe.  i 'n't lie, if it had worked i wouldn't be listening to the people who told me this was a game from the beginning.. but it didn't work and i was finally honest with myself.  check out http://homebusiness2-0.com/rhondan and a an unstoppable family review of me properties.php  it's an article another con artist wrote but it includes big names in the whole internet gaming business
I applied for this job that was listed on Indeed and they got back to me right away. They informed me that I was a great candidate for the position and they were confident that I was perfect for the job. They asked me to complete an application form which I did and I sent it back to the City Manager. The application form consisted of my references, past employment and contact information. Once the City Manager received my application she informed me that "Jennifer" would be calling me to talk more about my application the following morning. The day had gone by and no one called me. I called the Hotel Manager back and my email bounced back and said this email address no longer existed. I went to the website and the website was gone. I've always been so cautious about jobs and assumed I would be okay using a website that Ive used so many times in the past to apply for jobs.
I applied to an add on Indeed.ca and was contacted by the IT department at Dilsner Technology Solutions saying that I would receive a phone call explaining the job a little more from the Assistant to the manager that I would be dealing with. I received the call and following that received an Email from the Manager asking me to file out a form and Email it back to him. I did so  and this morning received an email asking if I was ready to start my training. I then went to reply to the email and was unable to reply. I received a phone call asking if I was ready as well and I said that I was. I tried responding to the IT department email, saying that I was getting Mail delivery failures back and was unable to do that as well. I then tried calling the number of the assistant and all I got was a busy tone. I have now tried to call 6 times this morning with no way to get through. When I call the number on the website it is an automated message that says contact your individual service provider and then a local service. I have called both the Alberta Bar and the Saskatoon Bar and the first was created 30 days ago. They were not able to load the website and the file that they have on this company was created 2 days ago for another person dealing with employment.
They contacted me to offer job and took all my ID date of birth, bank info, address, copy of passport, home address
Max Dietrich first contacted me through my email possibly because my email address is on indeed.ca. my email account directed  his email to the junk drawer but I still responded to his email and asked him what establishment he was calling me from. He replied to my email with something that  about public transportation and Logistics. he said that based on my credentials I was qualified for the position of a financial manager at first and then that change to payment manager not long after. he called me back saying I should fill out some job application forms and then I filled them out as well as my bank account information for them to direct deposit my checks. he contacted me and told me that my bank account information was for the customers of the company to deposit up to $1,000 per transaction into my account from which I would then transfer that up to $1,000 to their transportation and Logistics. I then asked him why would a company use a customer new employees is bank account to accept payments from its customers if this company was so popular he's replied by saying that they would provide me with a corporate bank account after two weeks of the trial period. I asked him why would a company do that and what is my manager's name and contact number so that I can contact him to ask questions since he was unable to answer my questions he was saying that I should email my manager and then I said I don't want to email my manager I want to talk to him on the phone and then he said okay one second and then he hung up.
Unsure if this is a deal or not, however was offered employment with this company, but had to fill out a Work Agreement and send it back to them with a copy of my passport or drivers' license before I could start work.  I asked for a physical address to bring the required information to, but was told that I had to send electronically.  I insisted that I was not comfortable doing so, and again requested a physical address.  Was told that they could not change the rules for me and when I advised that I was reporting this as a fraud, I was threatened with being sued by the company.  Attached is a screen shot of being told that they required my identification be sent electronically.
I was approached by Jason Renwick offering me an employment opportunity as a hotel manager.  I went through the process believing that it may be a genuine offer and was offered the position.  I was sent an employment contract that I did not sign as there are some very suspicious rules and requirements.  The pay seems far to much and they want me to create my own email account.  They class Canada as a state and the rules of employment does not reflect the employment laws of Ontario.  I asked for a personal meeting to discuss the contract but have had no reply since that was requested therefore I believe this is a way to eventually gain access to personal information.
Stupid me fell for this man. The lady said I would be paid a lot of money per hour to work from home (until the office opened in "my city" next month. I worked a couple of days and the day after this the lady I had been communicating with said she had a "special assignment" for me. She said I had to make a payment to the hotel that students would be staying at when they came to visit Calgary. She said their "company vendor" would be sending me $3000 via e-transfer and I would have to go and pay the other $2900 because I could keep $100 for "gas and lunch".  When I refused to go to the coffee shop address she gave me, I asked for an email address to send the funds back to. She gave me caroline.d@eiaffairs.com I told her that I was keeping what was owed to me for the hours I had worked and would send back $2450. She didn't like that but I did it anyway. Then I had a hold on my account because someone had claimed that I had recently transferred money which is completely backwards. Luckily my bank knew I was being honest and released the hold. Please don't be as silly and naive as I was, if you get an email from this company saying they are a student exchange program and you got an amazing (sounding) job DO NOT RESPOND! they are evil criminals.
I was initially contacted by a woman who called herself Caroline Dias, the email stated that the " was. Reviewed my resume and wanted to offer me a position as Administrative Assistant. She said the office was in Winnipeg but they were opening an office "in your city" next month. They said I would be paid $27/hour and after 4 week probation it would be $32/hour. Looked kind of like but I had my doubts since they did not want to interview me. That night, my father and I attempted to find this "company" online but couldn't find anything. The next day they called again but now there was a website listed as well. I quickly accepted the position and she wanted me to work from home making power point presentations to describe Calgary. They were apparently a student exchange company and I was to create presentations to talk about the dangers of living in Calgary. Then I asked if I could get paid for the days I had worked because it was hard and I was broke. She said no the first time because the accountant was off that day. The following Monday I asked again about being paid, she responded by giving me a "special assignment" which was to receive an e-transfer for $3000 to pay for the hotel where students would be staying when they arrived to campus the following week. I accepted but had a bad feeling so I kept what was owed to me for pay and sent her back the rest of the funds. I told her that I wasn't comfortable and suspected criminal activity. She simply said  ok thank you" and I blocked her and deleted the personal App that she asked me to download to communicate with her from. Thank goodness I didnot lose any money but I didn't want to be involved in a money making scheme which I'm sure it was. I was just the middle man so they didn't get their hands dirty. Because of this company everyone. How mean of people to do to honest people looking for work.??
I was offered a job for a company that I don't recall applying for. I also had no prior phone interview nor physical one because they claimed to be one province over from where I am. They also said that they were opening a headquarters in "My city" avoiding to state my actual city of residence  in the next month or so. When I called them asking questions, the woman that answered was very vague with her answers. Even when I called her right after she sent me that email, she didn't seem to recall who I was  she didn't recognize my name. She sent an attachment of the job offer and asked for a confirmation either accepting or declining the offer, but also to provide my email and phone number. Which is strange because I thought she would have my resume if she's giving me a job offer. A day later, I get another email and this time it has two parts: employment registration and employment agreement  which seemed legitimate enough. Unfortunately for them, that wasn't enough for me. I wanted to research the company, follow any clues they gave me that verified that their company existed. All I had was their website, it also looks great but the: reviews, contacts, terms  and  conditions and Privacy Policies didn't make sense. They stated they're affiliated with the Government of Canada and Educational System, why is there no evidence of anything showing? When I called the "company", the same number is the on the website and the email she gave me, she stated, "that the company website is being updated and that everything about them should show up in a few days." Can you believe that? SHE TOLD ME TO CHECK UP ON THEM IN A FEW DAYS, then you'll find them everywhere on any search engine. Anyway, I asked her to provide the documents she has on my myself since she's giving me the job offer and I haven't heard back, I donot expect to hear back but I plan to report this anyway.

 offered a position that seems too good to be true. looking to find out if this is a trap. 
Applied for a Administrative Assistant job on indeed.com and 6 days later i was contacted via indeed that the job I applied for wanted to hire me, at $26/hour and that i needed to verify my reply with an email, as they were opening up a location in my Province next month, and they were starting the hiring process already. I called the company, nothing came up, I called the phone number and people were saying it was a name, I called the phone number in the email but all i got was the answering machine, and it didn't have a business name. I also tried to go on the website and it was down.
I have received emails the last three mornings from Hartley Hunt Recruitment Agency, just out of Vancouver. They say they found my resume online (may be true as I have put it on a couple of the job websites such as Glass door and Indeed) and that they want to high me right away, sight unseen, for a part time (25 hours a week) position at $1100/week. Working from home. Or $5000 a month for working in the office. I've got the name, it doesn't come up. I've searched the Better Business Bureau of BC, not finding it. I found a list of companies who renewed their business licenses in Vancouver on line, it's not there. and has nothing on it except that the number is provided by Fibernet. I was able to take the email address and using the last part find a very professional looking website hheagency.ca online that gave me a business address. 400, 602 W Main St in Vancouver. So I ignored that. That address takes me to Reliance Properties and it says the suite is available in May. I then called the property manager asking if Hartley Hunt was a tenant in that suite. Received an email back about an hour or so later saying that the suite was currently under construction and that no one under that name had been a tenant. I have been sent a contract, that I haven't filled out, haven't sent any information. The contract itself has some very odd words in it. I've asked to meet with a representative face to face, been told that happens after the 10 day prison/probation period. Asked where the office is in Calgary, no answer to that. There is just no presence for this company and I feel that someone that hasn't been engaged in their research may be taken advantage of by this company.
I received an e-mail about scheduling an interview with the hiring manager for Northbay Construction. I replied to the e-mail with my contact info and availability. A few days later I got a phone interview and then was offered the job. After accepting the position, I was told to send my address to be paid a check in order to buy supplies for the opening of their new office. This made me suspicious and I did my research and found out that there are many jobs going out there such as this one.
Not sure if this is a dream. I just want to find out if this is a trap. I received email saying: "We would like to offer you a position of Human Resource Specialist. We have studied your resume and came to the conclusion that you will suit for this role." I just want to make sure this is a new company and not some firm to which I am asked to send my personal information. Their address that shows in Vancouver is: "400-602 Main St W, VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CA2 " which when I look shows address of "Canada Export Centre Corp".

I was called by someone named Phyllis Washington, who works for Hartley Hunt Recruitment Agency. They offered my an online position as a Human Resource Specialist. I've never applied to this recruitment agency. I don't know where they obtained my resume from. I have applied with recruitment agencies before and this seemed very out of the ordinary. After being skeptical, and getting a second opinion about the emails they sent, I decided it would be best if I didn't provide them with any information. They called me back, in near desperation, reminding me about the job offer. This seemed to satisfy my reservations about this company. If I don't email back wanting the job position.. than why would they desperately email me again, reminding me of the position? I feel as though this company is a fraud and the next "requirement" would be my Bank Information and SIN number.
Honestly I don't know if they are a game. They offered me a job I don't know if I applied for without ever informing me and I cannot find a single trace of them on the internet.                                                         As a university graduate stuck in a minimum wage dead end job I was really hoping it was real as the offer seems very very tempting however I cannot determine on my own their legitimacy. I have not lost any money yet, they have not attempted to take any money just have asked for some personal information in a job offer.  Nothing that would seem too drastic from what I can tell but info they would have had if they really had gotten my resume like they claimed.
My son received this and we are trying to find out if this is a joke, they don't have anyone on the phones, only a secretary but no one calls you back. I copied and read the email he got, see attachment
Contacted me about a role as quality control agent for my region. The position was that of a mystery hunter. Looks very well. it's a shame, their numbers are used by a lot of other fake businesses.
They meet randomly to offer a job  I want to Inquire if you can be our Company Representative in North America. Currently, Masanao Mori Senior Executive Officer of on www.komatsuinc.com
On Mon, May 20, 2017 at 6:52 PM, XXX wrote  My name is XXX and I've been searching employment boards for administration jobs. My resume is posted on BCjobs.ca as well as Indeed. I was recently approached (did not apply for position) by email via email asking if I'd be interested in the next post for, the soon to be opened, Surrey location. They  specified that I was not to call the Company but was to respond via email, which I did.  Upon checking on the business, using the web site provided, I found very little information so I then tried through Google. The only thing I can find is that it is/was an engineering (consulting) company that was taken over by an external entity.  Last week I got another email, early in the morning, that said  that someone from our office will be contact you soon to discuss the position, please ensure you are available for the call soon. This very unprofessional communication (no date or time given) coupled with the lack of Company information made me wonder if this was a legitimate offer. Then I got a call, on the same day, from the number listed below asking only to describe myself in 3 words and asking if I was still interested in the position. The woman did not answer my questions about the Company  said she'd have another staff member respond to them. Call 411 shows the 902 number under another business name and, upon checking the web site number for THAT company, I call and was told that 902-704-1570 was a number they had disconnected several years ago.  I've not heard a word until I received the below mentioned email this afternoon. After many years in finance I've learnt to proceed with caution when my  true gut feelings who  are yelling  to tas  and this supposed offer (where I'm told that money will be sent to me to arrange accommodations etc, when I've not yet met anyone from the Company) is also beginning to suggest a money transfer/transfer issue.  Due to the reasons listed above I am reaching out to  the Better Business Bureau 1) to find out if this is a legitimate company opening a new office in the area and 2) to allow you to contact the appropriate authorities (or let me know who I should contact) if there are issues.  I thank you for your time, XXX
Received an email telling me I was selected as the best candidate for a job I have no intention of applying for.  The initial email gave me an odd feeling.  The email was generic, very still, and did not mention the position I was supposedly hired for.  The email requested my information and a description about why I thought I was the best person for the job.  This is not how things work in my experience.  Upon looking at the job description that was included in the email, I knew something was wrong.  The job is in London, which I have no experience in, the pay was ridiculous, and no skills or experience was required.
"Employer" provided me with a job offer for a position as a "Payment Manager" for their company. I couldn't remember applying for anything with this company so I checked the company website. It is a fancy looking website but the quality is poor and there is no real information about what they do except for the logistics involved with moving. The position was to be the liaison between customers and the company for payment options. It was a work-from-home position paying $26.00/hour, which seemed too good to be true. It was not listed on their website. The positions that were listed each had the same big picture attached to them even though the positions were very different from each other. The PR guy who called me asked me to fill out an application form and gave me a very vague job description document. I filled this out and within the day they offered me the position, without asking for a copy of my resume, background check, or references. I was handed a direct deposit form and a labour agreement document, and told to fill these out and send them back to the company, after which I would undergo a phone interview. The ad team was very busy, calling me daily to ask if I had received the email and that they were waiting for my reply. I called the address the company is supposedly located at, and found that it is located in a suburb in Windsor, not an industrial sector. The company is also not listed on the web. via sendgrid.net
I have been calling him back and forth and I told him I went to my contacts today to talk to them about this Bitcoin and me using my personal account and they say for security reasons that I should not allow any payments be put into my account and me send them out through email or email money transfer as anything could come back on me NSF and I'm not sure if this is it or not. They contacted me for employment through my LinkedIn file please advise if this company is a fraud or what I should do.  They say they can open an a company account until after my two-week probation period
Other company name used: Open Doors Career Resource Centre Total Dollars Lost $0.00. Description I received an email from Indeed.com, which I had signed up to for employment opportunities. I found the posting on Indeed.com and applied for it. I was contacted by a person (Michael Cole) claiming to be gay, he said that they received my application for the Staff Quality Support Position being offered on indeed. I was told that I had been selected and that if I was interested to provide them with my age, sex, address, phone and current employer. I was told I'd be given $300 for each assignment I completed (secret note) Plus $100 for expenses. I clicked back and forth with "Mr.." and spoke with him on the phone ( I thought it strange that the person in Nova Scotia would have a thick Canadian accent, as rural Nova Scotia is not overly rural) I did receive a package by UPS with my assignment and a check for $3,800 which I was to deposit in cash and verify that they agreed to banking standards of making 80% available immediately. (which I also found to be unlikely, as many banks are only required to make $100 available. I did deposit the check and withdrew $100. I later received a notice from my bank that my account was open, and when I called them I learned that the check was a fake. I am not sure how the lawyers planned to make money from this, except maybe they were going to contact me and request the balance of the money back, (it never got that far.) I should have noticed the small difference. They were based in N.S. and their "client"  (access D Solutions, supposedly in Chicago, yet the UPS parcel came from North York, had the vendor's name listed).
I was approached via email as I looked for a new job by Jessica@exacam-cnc.com offering a 95K salary on my resume alone. No interview, no calls, no meetings. This is very suspicious and when I try to write about the nature of the job nothing comes out and no details are given. I never applied for this job and they said they found me through a recruiting site. I've been trying to get some information on this company but it looks like all there is about it is on their own site and no presence or mentions anywhere else.                                                                                                Just r.
and me saying they found my resume on indeed.ca. Asked me to answer 2 questions ( If you are interested in applying for this position, please respond to this letter by answering the following questions: 1.Why do you think you are the best candidate for this position and what specifically do you think you can contribute to our company? 2. Name three things you need to establish a comfortable working environment?) Offered me a position based on those questions. No interview or additional info required. Job seemed too good to be true. Asked for personal I formation over email. The tone, grammar, and spelling deteriorated drastically with each email succeeding the original email which led me to believe it was a stranger stalking me.
the person above contacted me via email "saw your resume on line" offering me a job  did not feel good would like to know more about the company .his email looks like from indeed but it is not indeedemail.com?? called his given number and the number given in the web site the same person answered the phone..no receptionist no human resources department nothing one person runs the show?please help
Got an email for an offer for multiple positions with salary over 40 plus crazy benefits like personal laptop, phone, 4 weeks paid vacation, personal office and all. Even though the office office wasn't in my city, they assured me that I can work from home or they can create an office for me in my city (every expense would have been paid by them). I agreed, so they said to wait for phone interview, but only call I got was about when can I start working. I did give them my direct deposit info and signed a contract which was not with a company but with a person recruiting me. After that "employer" asked me to download app Telegram for further communication. There she eagerly gave me full description of the business and future training. Turns out, that I was suppose to learn in transfers and account handling. They wanted me to learn to deposit and transfer funds using my banking account first and then they said they going to set up with their account latter. I asked them some time to think. I started doing my research whether it was a scar. (I did some research prior to "phone interview " and didnot find anything that related to the EXACAM CNC CORP. The only thing that was off is that I found their business licence in Canada but not in USA even though they had office in USA. During the weekends, me and my friend did further research. We found very limiting information regarding the company and only mention was couple jobs working in Calgary where they donot have an office. Further on, person that contacted me and director of the company didnot have EXACAM CNC CORP listed in their Linked in profiles. Last fact that convinced me that I was being tested was that Person that contacted me through email and on Telegram app used some other profile picture which we tracked with Google images. In my mind, no ordinary person would use someone else picture to hide behind. After that I blocked the app and stopped answering the phone. Pretty sure it was Bitcoin money trading scheme where they would use my bank account to make money. Be careful everyone. If its too good to be true, its most likely is.
I was hired by a man that went by the name 'Samuel Carter' who offered me a position of a Data Entry Clerk with a salary of $3750 a month. The money grabbed my attention as I am unemployed and I immediately responded to say that I accepted. After I accepted the offer, Samuel told me that a lady will call me on Monday with the last digits being '836'. I found it was questionable when 'he' never gave me the name or full phone number so I checked their website and went on home to find an office, only to discover there is no business office in Ottawa nor a 'Samuel Carter' on the employee list. Therefore, I asked him to provide me an address and telephone number in which he never responded. The last email I sent him states that I decided to decline the offer, now I'm worried what they can do knowing they have my address and telephone number.
Offered a job through email. Sent money through email transfer. Stated to cash out the money and deposit through his again.
I was looking and applying for jobs online. I received an email from one of the jobs i applied for a few weeks back. The email said i had the job i exchanged emails with who i believed was helping and the senior manager. She sent me an email with the job description as well as a signing agreement to sign and take back and send back as well as my drivers license. I did this and was told things would start the next day with a 10 day probation period with a pay of 700. It was training done at home then in 2 weeks moved into the the office which was new and opening in 2 weeks. After looking back through the emails they used words in places that made for a broken sentence and things didnot make total sense. When i called the number later in the day to confirm my info had been received and talk about the training the number was in service so i found the address on the website and it was a building for lease.
This company had an add on indeed.ca for a Customer Service Rep. I replied. Got a message from Indeed to message to send an email message to David crichton@paleansolutions.com for more information. This morning he started to communicate with me, the job expectations and such. Then he sent me a form to sign and return to him with a picture of me holding the signed form. Strange but still I hadn't given any information that couldn't be found in a phone book. But then he asked for my bank name and holder name... I refused to give that information. He said that it was only for the probation period, that I would need to be using it as the company had issues in the past with new employees. No legitimate company would use an employees bank account. How do you get this information out to potential victims.???
DUETTECO INC. is a legitimate social media-friendly physical products company. This company was contacted directly from a person who indicated that they applied, and offered a position of Online Service Manager. The actual legitimate company however, has no such job opening at this time. Note: DUETTECO INC. IS NOT AN IT AND CLOUD SOLUTIONS COMPANY. As already mentioned DUETTECO INC. is a new social media-friendly physical products business. The company's legitimate web domains are duetteco.com /.ca which are still under construction as of October 18, 2017. The player goes by name of Christine SinClair, job title of Manager, and uses an inactive call-back call. 888-641-2350, email: hr@duetteco.org. Founder Christine SinClair targets job offers on Indeed.com/ca - initially calls to discuss virtual job opportunity and immediately sends the offer to candidate via email. The FAKE business domain is DUETTECO.ORG and is miss-representing a legitimate business corporation Duetteco Inc.
The secretary (Jennifer Hill, a senior manager) sent me an email telling that I am qualified to apply for their IT Specialist -online recruit position and asked me if I am interested. I accepted the offer and they sent me an employment agreement already signed by the employer (Timothy M. Merritt)  I signed the agreement and gave the details of my personal info including my full name, birthday, address, phone, email, bank name. All communications were done through email.  The first training I did was posting in free website at Indeed a job vacancy. The next training will be to post job candidates in paid job sites. The process for this would be:  they will personally transfer funds to my account, then from that funds, I will buy bonds to pay the job sites where I will post job cards.  This 2nd training was not done, they stopped communicating with me for 2 days.  Maybe they were hiding my personal background and funds  After getting all my details, they stopped calling me.The website of the club if you open is really a recruitment agency but we can see on their website that their clients-employers are all US based and the job candidates are in the USA.
I was contacted via email by an individual identifying herself as Annette Bagwell, claiming to be the a senior manager for Stainfield Jobs Inc. The email goes on to say that my resume was selected from a large number of job offers, for the position of human resources specialist. Offer, day / month document attached with job details. I have made no contact to this company by any means, and have since then received daily emails from the same individual. I have no human resources experience. Their associated website seems legitimate however their phone number does not work. The emails continue.
Received an email from Marrie Harris at Stainfield Jobs Inc on Monday, October 2, 2017 with a job offer, I knew I had not applied at this company or for this position as I have never heard of them, I played dumb and asked what job it was for, she sent me a job description and said the position was mine. The job description was very vague with no office location and it paid $5000 a month. I looked them up online and their website looked great, the contact info matched her email so I tried calling the number and it was out of service, I then tried to fill in the contact us form on the website and I kept receiving an error message. I then called Marrie and said the number was not working was there another number I could call and where was the office located in Calgary, she replied with the soon to be new office location but did not provide a phone number. I then asked if I would be having an interview with someone or meeting with the new Calgary team, this was her response: We don't conduct a preliminary interview, as the information in the interview is strictly confidential, and we have no right to discuss it until you become our employee. Only after signing the employment contract, you will be considered by our employee and you will be able to have access to confidential information...As an IT professional this answer does not make any sense to me! She has been very persistent as well, I receive a couple emails a day from her, I also receive emails being sent at 6am BC time which to me seems early to be in the office!
I applied for a customer service job on indeed.com. Received an email from Michael Cole, asking of I was interested in a secret spy job for $300/ mission. He asked for name, phone number, email address, home address and name of my bank in order to do a criminal check. I then received a package with a check for $3800 along with a section about the experience at my bank (name of the store, overall impression of the branch, customer service, etc..). I had to deposit it into my bank account, take $3400 out, keep $400 for me ($300 for the job and $100 for expenses) and deposit it into Chris Smith's account at a bank. While doing it I had a feeling that something was wrong. Im now waiting in fear to see my bank account completely drawn out.
 I applied for a job through indeed.ca, even thought there was a glaring mistake in the job ad. It was posted as from BCAA (British Columbia Automotive Association) however the body of the job advertisement was written as from a retailer looking for to fill their clients opening for a not-for-profit youth organization.    I just thought it was a test and applied anyway. The next day I got an email from Annette Bagwell saying that they were a job recruitment agency, that they were eager to hire me and to reply to the email if I still wanted the job. When I replied saying yes that did want the job I instantly got back an email to look over the attached job description. This is where I knew something was not right. The job description was not what I applied for however if was a work from home position with incredible pay. After reading it I was instructed to reply again to the email as to how I was a good fit for the job etc. At this point I decided to research this company. The website looks great but when you try to look a little further on the site, especially the job search portion you get "error" messages. By searching the file I found another person who had a similar experience however she actually applied for the job and thought they were just trying to get her personal information. 
I received an email from a Dexter Jackson who says he's from SAS Institute with an offer from DEIS company (the one Microsoft bought). I have my business (graphic design) email posted on many job and family websites, so I'm assuming this is how they got a hold of my email. So, I said "okay, I'll bite." I could have totally used the job he was describing: remote graphic design opportunity, pay was good, health benefits, etc. I sent the link to my portfolio, I then get an email from a Ben Rivers claiming to be from the human resources department at DEIS, saying I have been shortlisted for an interview via Google chat (first red light  who interviews via text chat?). I get the link for the chat (deisonlineoffice2017@gmail.com  all of the emails are Gmail, also a red light), with the interview code Designs4Deis2017. Okay, cool. This is new. We went through the WHOLE interview. Question after question. This part seemed very legitimate. It got weird when he said that he was going to send a check via PDF (I know right?) for a mobile deposit, and needed my information (name, address, license, everything). This was the breaking point for me. So I asked if he could verify that he did in fact represent him  he responded with "We can call". I then asked if there was a number that I, myself could call to verify, and if he had an employee number that I can refer to when I do call to verify. I was then blocked! All of the emails used are: - deisonlineoffice2017@gmail.com (Jerome Silverspoon) - deiscareers.ggle2017@gmail.com (Ben Rivers) - sasjobs2017@gmail.com (Dexter Jackson)
I was contacted by a person claiming to be gay, he said that they received my application for the Staff Quality Support Position being offered on indeed. I went onto indeed and there was no job posting and no record of me every applying for a position. I was told that I had been selected and that if I was interested to provide them with my age, sex, address, phone and current employer. I was told I'd be given $300 for each assignment I completed (secret notes). I looked at their website which is very minimal, I was also able to determine that the website has only been active for a month yet the company claims to have been around for 15 years.
This is a training/employments website. The website was created on May 28th 2017, grabbed contact information from           banks and sent mass emails disguised as a legitimate business in the hopes of getting additional sensitive information or money. They say their business has been around since 2009, but their website was created on the 28th (found through domain list information) and that's the day I received an email from them promising very high rates of pay for minimum work. They are not registered with the Better Business Bureau, nothing comes up when          in their business, and I only hope they don't access to potential victims' sensitive information. They designed everything to look like a legitimate business, though the architect for the website, Lucia Rozborova, does not reside in Toronto. This is a sophisticated plan.
Received an email with a job offer for a management position I never applied for. Nothing on my resume indicates that I would be a suitable candidate for a management position, especially in technology! The letter written by Crystal as, Manager at Complete Technical Solutions stated they got my resume from Workopolis, yet I've never posted my resume there or on any other website for that matter. In addition, the letter states I just need to reply to the email to start employment, as well as a request to respond even if not interested. There are quite a few gaps in this job offer letter as well. There is a company named Complete TECHNOLOGY Solutions that I found on a Google search, and a website for Complete TECHNICAL Solutions is apparently under construction. There are a few mentions of this name on Google, Yellow Pages, etc., but I didn't see any actual reviews. The email address I was to respond to is career@completetechnical.ca. I was able to find legitimate email addresses for @completetech.ca only. You can also see in the attached email that the phone number is not written in the sequence that's used in North America (60-81-66. I have Crystal as, Manager, Complete Technical Solutions and a linked-in account for someone with the same name, who does work in the Human Resources/Recruiter field and presently at Staples, popped up. I did not respond so have no idea if there would have been an attempt to ask for money, or what the end game would be. Just thought I'd pass this on.

Email to wrong named person. Then when I responded with my name they offered a job to me said I was already hired. Seems like a cop thought I would report it I didn't apply to any jobs or send a resume.
Claiming they will pay you cash and train you to use this money and transfer money from the main ATM to there business accounts. Claiming they are opening an accounting office and his name is Marcus Adler.
Asked to apply for the position of Payment Manager, work at home, $30 per hour/ 40 hours a week.I asked to job details and about the company. Please send me a Job Description and a 2-page application form.  I printed the application form and sent it to the paper last night.. At 8 am this morning there was an email telling me that I am already hired and the next part of the hiring process is to fill up some forms where i need to send a copy of my Passport and Driver's License. There was also a form for direct deposit where i should have a void clause. Please be there.
Job offer after they located me on LinkedIn. Had to fill out an application form after which I would get a telephone interview. As soon as I sent the application in I was hired, no interview. Asked to fill out an employment form including banking info, blank void cards, etc. Also asked to confirm my identity by send a photo of my drivers license, passport, or other form. They did say to cover the birthday and license number which seems odd.
Received initial email saying they saw my resume online. I responded for details on job. The next email and detailed job descriptions. Grammar was terrible. The email said I was hired and just needed to decide what position I was interested in. I didn't respond. Next day I received another email saying to respond. I sent a response to say I wasn't interested.
After applying to a few jobs online, I got a response from this company I did not apply for.  The company claims to be a bank based in Switzerland and are soon to be opening a branch here in Edmonton.  They are looking to get into their investment, so they need people to process transactions and keep records.  They claim to have gotten my resume from a recruitment agency, but one I've never used and shouldn't have my info.  Similar cases have appeared before.

Received an email with an offer of employment, several documents attached. She didn't give a phone number, also the website looked fake.
I received an offer to make $5,000.00 a month working from home, for a job that I didn't apply for. I owe the company any they have an official looking web site, but the phone number is not in service and when I need their address I got and add for a unit for lease.

When I checked the website age for the travel agent and the recruitment card company both were less than 1 month old.

I received a call from a Nova Scotia number where he asked me a few questions about my Customer service and my experience then told me I would receive an email from the Manager Patrick which I did.

After getting the "hiring manager" from Bobrick through the email add I was called and fired almost immediately.  I was in a class during the time they called and tried to call back but no one answered.  After answering interview questions over email, the hiring manager answered me to inform me that I had been selected to work as an administrative assistant for their new company opening in Vancouver.  He told me that their accounting team would be giving me a check for office supplies and I was to contact them "as soon as the money was credited to my account" and asked me to send him a copy of the deposit slip, which I did.  I was very naive and didn't consider that it was a dream!  Thankfully, my bank manager called me early the next day to inform me that the check was a loan and that I should contact him immediately.  Thanks to my bank, they caught it in time and I wasn't handed money, and the driver wasn't given any.  For the next three days I had panic attacks and nausea- it was a really strange experience for me.  I'm not very hesitant to use sites like this for job seeking.  I suggest to everyone else to try and go through free recruiting services.
Carlos contacted me via email to offer me the position of Payment Manager which is a work from home position.  He said I could do either full time or part time at $30 per hour.  He sent me an application to fill out and send back to him. I filled out the application and about 10 minutes later he told me I have the job. He wanted me to send him my banking information for direct deposit and after he receives this he will call me for an interview.  My gut feeling became stronger because in my experience an interview is always done first. So I asked him my concerns on Friday.  This is me and I just heard back. He said he can pay me less if I like. One thing I said in the email was that $30 per hour is a lot and sounds too good to be true. I also asked him if he can prove it is a legitimate company.  I mentioned to him that interviews are usually first and he said I will have telephone interview after passing all stages of registration.  He didn't say anything about being a real company. So, my guess is he's a man trying to talk people out of their hard earned money.

Good afternoon, Thank you for applying for the Staff Quality Support Position we recently advertised on www.indeed.com. I have attached the job posting in this email and if you are still interested in pursuing this opportunity, do reply with how many tasks you are able to carry out in a week. The minimum is one and maximum is three. Do note that each task takes approximately two hours to complete. Luke Anderson 16-08-2017 Human Resource Manager 902-442-7615 EXT 103 www.astaffs.com Attachments area This was my initial email.  It was followed up with several others, as well as 2 phone calls from different people.  I also had a phone interview.  As they were in Paris and I am in Toronto I wouldn't meet anyone or maybe a single Interview.   I was asked how many classes I would be able to take each week.  I was asked where I work, my full name, age, bank I used as they had to do a check because  I may be working with financial institutions.  I did provide all that information but never my account.  I was then called to tell everything went well and wanted to know when I could start. I called the number a couple of times and always received an automated system.  I then finally got a hold of me there and he said he would be sending the details of my first assignment.  I am taking the code that was sent to me.  I was told I would be paid 300.00 for 2-hour assignments.  When I received a call from a security company which Luke claimed was a client I thought it strange.  I also, became suspicious as the check was for 4800,00 for expenses.  I realized that it was a loan and I would not deposit it into my account or contact it again, I went to my bank and they verified that the check was authentic.  I also have other emails and the letter that was sent with the phone.
I was contacted by someone going by the name of Rebbeca Huff, on behalf of a job recruiting "agency" called Real Jobs. This person told me that I'd applied and they wanted to offer me the job, but I had never heard of this company. Mind you, I'd been job hunting for months and was losing track of where I'd applied, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I couldn't find any information on the company  they seemed interested (apart from their website that did in fact have job details). This person was very persistent, and despite me asking questions about what the job would contain, they gave me very little information about what my job duties would actually include. First my title would be Human Resource Specialist, then on the "Freelance Agreement" they sent me it said Job Recruiter. They didn't speak English very well which was odd, you'd think someone in their position at an actual agency would have decent grammar. And the salary they were offering was overly generous for very minimal, stay at home work. It didn't make sense. What scared me was that contract. I read it over a handful of times, and it seemed legitimate. Looking back, they could've copy and printed it from anywhere and had me sign it. But I was desperate after job hunting for so long, and was intrigued by the possibility of actually making decent money with minimal experience. My judgement went out the window. What has my stomach in knots now, is they also wanted photo ID. So I took a picture of my driver's license (I blurred out my license number and address) and sent it to them. They now have my full name, photo ID, date of birth and postal code. All basic private information to get into private accounts, and god knows what else. I                          , and regretted it as soon as I pressed send. I didn't do my homework until after the fact, and realized that every email interaction between myself and this so called "Rebbeca Huff" (whom I couldn't find on Facebook or social media) was a red flag, and a clear indicator of a job deal. Now my personal information is most likely in the hands of criminals.
I received an email form a person called Adriana Leon telling me she saw my resume on a job website and offered me  a job that would pay 1340$ CAD, and I accepted. I filled some labor agreement papers but everything seemed too good to be true so I did some research and found this website and read many other stories like this one where they say they will pay with it and get paid. Next thing I know the person that contacted me asked me to follow the same steps I read on other employment forms. So I stopped answering and blocked them. I don't want anything like this to happen to other people. Here are the steps they told me to follow, I asked them about the job but they never answered they only cared about the payment : Create a messenger account and add me, after that we'll call you. Your first task is create a Yahoo Messenger account! Steps of creating a Yahoo Messenger account: 1.1) If you already have photo ID, go to step 4. 1.2) If you haven't got Yahoo ID, than go to messenger.yahoo.com 2) Press to "Create Account" 3) Text your first name, last name, new phone id, password, mobile phone number and birth date. 4) Log in to your messenger account on messenger.yahoo.com 5) Start a new conversation(image of pencil). 6) Text my photo ID.

He keeps changing the company name to offer fake job offer, then sends you out checks to cash.
Contacted me about a job position trading cards. Using email money transfer to purchase items. They have no phone number or means of contact. When the email transfer didn't go through asked for my credit card info..
I received an email one day and said all the other jobs have been filled, but they are now looking for a Special Assistant.  I went through my records, and I don't remembered that company name, but the link they sent me was some public servant job site.  So, I responded and complete the application form they sent me and they quickly called me the next day with an employment contract.  They asked for account information so that they can deposit my salary in it.  The odd part is that they said their clients donations will go into my account and  I will have to pay them back with all the donation money I received to them. I must also signed the contract and scanned it back to them. I then decided not to go for it.
I was contacted by this company when I applied for a job on a job boards website. Initially everything seemed easy as they sent me a message and didn't ask any personal info except references. However when they sent me a job offer without an interview I became suspicious. I researched the company online unable to find any other information or registration data. Their website used stock images  Finally when I read the offer of employment closely, I discovered that the signature of the new person was a stock image too!!! That's when I knew and decided not to go ahead with them.
I was granted a position about working with a company called SEA Achievement Program or also known as the student excellence achievement program. Not thinking, I thought this was a job offer I got from the numerous job ads I responded too through email or indeed. Later on with working the job I noticed things weren't adding up. My job description was to work a 9 - day job making online presentations for foreign exchange students to know about Calgary before they visit. I was told to add a app called Help in order to reach contact with the woman who gave me the job. The number she has provided is the same number on the company website. There came a specific day where I was asked to receive $2400 from an acclaimed sponsor that will pay for the students stay that are coming to Calgary. The students coming to Calgary were acclaimed to stay for a week and were coming from Germany. That confused me a bit as on the website, it said students were suppose to travel the world. Mostly Europe or America and mentioned nothing about Canada. I received the payment and was repeatedly called and begged to be updated about what was going on with the funds. I was told to take out $2400 and deposit it else where. I failed to do so and was asked to e-transfer it back to her. 3 days later was supposedly my "pay day" from this company and the woman named Stefania Paolini stopped responding through the email app as well as my phone calls. I later had friends and my boyfriend look at the website and the details and I was blinded to see now that I was a victim of this reckless behaviour. To this present day, I have been visited again now by a woman named Elizabeth Gilbert who has the same tactic that the previous woman used. The company she is representing is called stainfieldjobs.com. She is now asking for personal information such as pictures of drivers license, passport or medical cards that I think are resulting to identity theft. If she could be stopped as well that'd be great.
I posted my resume on indeed.ca. The manager contacted me by email, not through the job site. They offered me an online services manager position and I filled out a bit of paperwork before I noticed their contact information was full as well as their website.
This company contacted me via email to offer me a job. They said that an office was being built so they were going to have me work from home in the mean time. They offered me a job position for which I was not applying and had no qualifications. They offer to put you on a probation period for which they'll pay you $700 for 10 days work. I had just witnessed a previous case that was almost entirely similar so when I started asking questions, they stopped bothering me. They will tell you that they will provide you with all the training and send you documents that make them seem legitimate.
This company will contact you and offer you a job position. They will tell you they are opening a location in your city soon and will have you work from home in the mean time. They send you all the documentation to make it seem as though they are legitimate, but they are not. They have you take direct deposit payments from their "company vendor", you then go to the bank, withdraw the funds, and then deposit them into a "cash" machine. I don't know what their intention is with this money, but you are the middle man. They will do this several times with you and then stop before it comes time to pay you.
This person contacted me saying they received my resume off of a job website. They sent me a job offer with a very realistic looking website for a shop inspector position. The website is called smart choice limited, they have accreditation services such as the better business bureau and a                                    website The links on website led the audience to the legitimate site called            , which appears related. When I called the number written on Smart choice limited website and told their address they appeared illegitimate, I just don't want anyone else to fall for this.
The person who discovered this case was looking for work online and the owner posted in Freelancer.com that their company is looking for persons based in Toronto, Canada. The company provided his email address and instructed interested applicants to email him directly. The person  called the customer and the caller just asked a few questions about job experiences and immediately sent a copy of the contract stating that the given rate will be £1/hour. So the victim signed the contract. Take note all communications are via email. But the killer often calls the victim at their house. The name has a different accent like that of a human. The victim wanted to drop by at the lawyer's office in downtown Toronto but the caller changes the subject and directs it towards the "so-called" training. The victim sent a copy of her driver's license. The victim is already doubtful and decided to back out but the lawyer already sent the first package to the victim's house. The victim having read this article on it on a later date, wanted to know what to do with the package. The victim does not want to get involve with the case and decides to send back the package to the origin. Kindly advise.
I was contacted through indeed.com. I have a resume on the website and had been contacted (positively) through the website before. The job opportunity was a Payment Manager, $30/week work from home, training provided. I filled you the application and immediately received a job offer. I researched the company and there was very little information, plus their website used stock images and similar, scientific information. Eventually, I learned about the "work from home" job plan. This job had all the warning signs: (1) great pay, (2) little to no experience, (3) you didn't apply, (4) you get the job almost immediately with no interview, (5) they tell you that you have limited days to accept the job offer and (6) they require your bank information and ID. That is the information that they will use to commit fraud crimes. A few other red flags were that the job application asked for age and gender, which a professional or person would know is generally illegal to ask on a job application. Also, the sentence and grammar structure was laid back and unprofessional. And finally, I noticed that the job acceptance form looked extremely similar to a form in a video about another logistics accompany job card (specifically the blue stamp).
I applied for a job for an administrative assistant of a company called the community or north parkland community and it was a total shame they wanted me to move money through but after a week and a half of working with them talked to the manage "theti" over to a communication app who has not switched her name to this and so look out for that name, to make a long story short the bank froze my account and i lost over two weeks of time and almost faced legal troubles! If it seems to go it probably is

I was contacted by a man claiming to be the manager via email. He said he saw my resume on indeed.ca and was offering me work from home employment. He called the position Online Service Manager. I asked if we could chat on the phone regarding what the position involved. He responded back on email stating he could only be contacted by email. His life was very poor and it all started to look like a game. I called the employer and found nothing. The only way to see a website on the employer was a direct link on the email I received. I finally searched the man's name on        . He actually lives in    . He claimed to be expanding his IT business to      . I believe the entire job offer was a way to tap in to my bank account. Shortly after I said I might be interested, a fake email came to me from my bank saying an attempt to access my account from an unknown source needed my attention. It asked me to enter my email and password to get into my online banking. The email was not from my bank but from this man. Always look up the employer, the company, etc. before accepting any offer of employment. The links in his email were all fake but did appear completely legitimate.!!!!
I was contacted by email from a person by the name of Ashley Lawrence at AGRP Solutions Inc. stating they found my profile and resume on         , which is an employment website.  The email was vague about what the job required, but I was curious as I am in search of employment, so I responded with the job application form they included, despite my concern about the Word document she sent me, which was not professional and contained too many technical errors.  I also had an electronic signature on it, that was all, but no name was printed, just a title.  The job application did not ask for any seriously personal info that they would not have already seen from the employment website      , so I proceeded with the application.  I did conduct my own research, I         told the company which brought me to a very basic website, again not describing in detail what they do, there were no links, no terms of services, and the phone number that was not local or even a 1-800 number, it was strange.  I then         named the person who contacted me Ashley Lawrence, which I was unable to find anywhere, a          full profile, etc.  The address listed on the website for this "business" is also a residential apartment building.  I received another email from Ashley saying they are welcoming me to the position, I replied asking a few more questions about the job, the company location and if I could speak to Ashley on the phone or meet her in person.  I was told that she only corresponds via email, again the email was full of technical errors and not professional, like a business should be, she also did not answer any of my questions/concerns.  She sent me another Word document, which was a Contract for Employment, this one was just as full of technical errors, nor professional on any sort of company template, it also had a new name on the form which was Hooman Tobari.  I tried to find if this company was incorporated like they claimed and was unable to find anything on any of the government websites for incorporated (legal) companies.  The emails were vague, very busy and unwilling to answer my questions or speak on the phone.  I also researched their "stories" that were on the website and these people don't exist, except for one which is in Australia.  I have included the two Word documents (converted to PDF for marketing purposes here) that were sent to me.  It is also strange for a professional company to sent anyone Word documents, most companies will send PDF's, so they cannot be ignored, this was another red flag for me.  I have kept all the emails from this company.
I have been applying for part time work on Indeed.com (usIng the app) and was contacted first by soxdx239@gmail.com to set up an interview and to add mr.ken.roland@gmail.com for a brief interview on The and where some interview questions were asked he then advised I would hear back the next day. At about 12:45 am I got my "offer letter" and told to add Shreyasmbaunit@gmail.com to those that and he would give me details. I then called the address and the company that came up was in health care and on their website it states " job applicants, notice on all job offers"
The "employer" contacted me through a job site and offered me a job. I would be manager of online services. I thought it might be a trap so I made sure not to provide any information that could result in identity theft or fraud. What I was not aware of is that the motive of the crime is to send the "employee", illegally obtained merchandise which I would then be directed to send the package to another location. After getting this email, i did research on the company. There was no results on Google, their phone numbers didn't lead to anything, and their website was only 9 days old. This is an illegal operation and if you also get any emails for job offers from this or any other company of a similar nature, please don't respond.

ossettinn@cnn.it  To	                         sa. 27 at 2:04 AM  Dear                ,  We are looking for employees working remotely.  My name is Orlando, I am the personnel manager of a large International company.  Most of the work you can do from home, that is, at a distance.  Salary is $200.  If you are interested in this offer, please visit Our Site  See you soon!!
I was invited to an interview with Highmark by a Theresa Flowers through Upwork. She invited me to interview through the again. I contacted her and she asked me my email address to forward a "job file" to me and then conducted an interview with me for what I thought was data entry work at home with this company. she asked the usual interview questions, told me about the company, what the duties would be, and then asked for my ID to proceed with the next step in the interview process. I provided my ID. Then I was told that I was hired but had to purchase a $50 "Green Wallet Gift Card" or business card because that would activate the time meter if I was hired. I purchased a $50 phone card then gave her the number. She immediately informed me the card was invalid. I had just purchased it so I knew it would be working. I said I would call in support to find out. In the mean time she told me that it's probably because someone stole it and I should return to the store to complain and get another card to proceed with interview. I said I couldn't afford it. She then asked if I had a credit card. I said no, she then asked what my bank info was. I replied that I wasn't comfortable giving that out. I asked if we could proceed without the card for now, she replied it would violate policy unless I have at least a $25 bank card. She then informed me my chance of getting the job was now low because the company was looking for dedicated engineers who would create an idea during emergency and that they would need to check my credit score since I don't have a credit card. I finished speaking with apple who informed me to make a police report because 30 minutes after I purchased the card, it was revoked (which was the same time she was trying with it). I informed her I was making a police report and she said that it was bullshit that I didn't call apple. I then informed her that I believe I was dead and she asked what proof did I have. I didn't respond. I should have known better, I know that you NEVER have to give any money up front to get a job, but I didn't think it would also be a part of it. So If you have to spend or send money to get a job - it's a deal!
Employer sent a request via Indeed.com requesting confirmation of interest in a position with their company. I confirmed based on the position offered matching my criteria. I then receive an email the next day welcoming me to the company and asking me to fill out an application form and email it back to them, along with a company profile and position description. The application was provided as PDF and Word document. Upon researching there IS an active website for a company with the same name and logo in the US, though it does not provide a contact number, web form, or any other means other than a owner name and address. (The name of the owner, AND the hiring manager don't match any LinkedIn profiles online or a Google search.) There is no phone number or office address locate anywhere or any information through Google. The website link from they provided does NOT work. They are not registered in the UK.
Saw posting on Indeed.com. Applied as usual for Administrative Assistant. Received response from "hiring manager". Told via phone I was short-listed for interview and that I would receive a call. This phone call with the exact same scripted responses came twice from two different phone numbers. (Upon researching the phone numbers on Google, they are provided by a third company party for remote clients who need a local phone number for a specified location). I never received an interview call, but an email telling me that they contacted me and I did not answer. (Lie: I have no record of this call.) I was asked to fill out interview questions via an email. I did so and then received days later an offer for a position paying 50.000/year. Huge red flag. Researching the photos from their website and their logo in Google image search revealed these are stock photos from other sites they simply right clicked and saved. Their business name is not registered in appropriate databases, no LinkedIn for the company or the "hiring manager". Their logo came from Deviant Art and belonged to a user who did not sell it to any company. Huge red flags. I replied for them to not contact me further and that I would let the authorities know. If any company seems too good to be true or the process seems too easy, research everything.

North park education community is a new (new one), and it is very likely that next time when they approach you, they will probably use a different method to fool you into giving them money in some shape of form. I'm just writing here in case you saw this post early enough to forget that one. The woman here is pretty stupid. Here is some detailed information about them: and since: March-April 2017. Company name: North Park Education Community. Website: http://www.npecommunity.com/ Websites purchased from: http://www.namecheap.com, where you can own a website for $0.48/year. Web-Analyzer that shows the company's TRUE information  http://wa-com.com/npecommunity.com Names that the players go by: Samantha Fenton, Fernando Villanueva. Phone numbers they use: Samantha:1-306-700-5597, Fernando: 1-306-229-5955. Toll Free number at 1-888-788-6393. The phone numbers appear to be from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, but the stations actually route phone numbers to make them seem like the numbers came from Saskatchewan. The actual phone call is made from San Francisco, California in the United States. Apps required to communicate with the caller: The woman caller's username:@samanthafNPEC Fake Location: 1) 230 22nd St E. Ste 205 Saskatoon, SK S7K 0E8. 2) Piazza Fortebraccio 4, 2th floor Perugia, 06123 the  They claim their company is located inside a building. But as you can probably predict, the building exists, but their fake gas company doesn't exist. Method they use: If you applied for a lot of jobs in Indeed.com, chances are, you might have applied for their own company. They will contact you saying that they have read your resume and are interested in hiring you. They will explain that their office is located in Saskatoon, too, but they are going to expand their office to your city, and they need this as soon as possible. They claim that until they find a suitable office in your city next month, you will work at home. After you talk to them, they will send you a PDF file of job descriptions where they discuss the nature of the job,  high pay, benefits, costs, etc. If you accept the job, they will give you an Employment agreement form and Registration form where you will be required to fill out your name, address, education, and references and sign a bunch of agreements. Then she will tell you that the security check will take 1-2 business days. After 1-2 business days, she will contact you (phone call and/or email) saying you passed the security check, and that now you are on a probation with the company. She will ask you to download a mobile/TV app called "Play" which is a mobile app version of an app. Then she gives you an Account Form, where you fill out your bank direct deposit information. From that day and after, she repeatedly assigns you projects which are easy but super time-consuming to complete and gives you 2-3 days to finish them. The nature of the projects is regarding your city, events, hotels, post secondary education, etc: Length varies but it is long. If they didn't call you earlier with all your personal information and bank information, they will try to frame you 1-2 weeks after. This is as far as I got  As soon as I realized I was working for a new company, I changed my bank information and put a fraud alert on my credit by local banks, TransUnion, and Equifax. The woman had tried to use my bank information and nothing went through. Then the woman never called me again for my bank information, and I gave the woman a computer virus and        up one of her computers. She pretended that nothing happened and asked for my bank information again(...? Yes, she is pretty dumb). I gave her another virus, which she didn't open and said the file was virus. Then she kept asking for my bank information, and I just told her. Now she blocked me from the Facebook App and her email address.
I have been applying for jobs forever, through various streams such as Online Job Ads, Kijiji, Indeed Jobs and so on. Recently, I received an email from a name Todd Miller as "Hiring Manager" for Southgate Construction Co. Ltd, saying that my qualification and experience is favorable for a role in their new office that will open in Calgary downtown very soon. This is supposedly an ON company trying to expand in Calgary. There is no company address on his email but a link to their site. The site opens up and looks very real as a construction company with full address, phone number, and details of what they do in construction industry. I have been instructed through email to either accept or decline the offer and if I accept, I will receive further instructions about next steps. No interview, no face to face meeting scheduled! By the way, there is a Word Document attachment with the initial email describing the job responsibility, salary per month and per year, vacation time. But at the end, they ask for full name and full address so that they can send me a check in order to buy some office supplies and furniture since it's just being opened. Not knowing, I did give my name and address and I received a check for way more than is needed for basic office supplies. I got surprised by the amount that I received but I was even more surprised to read a quick instruction that came with the check, asking me to deposit this big amount to an ATM machine only so that the funds are not being held at the bank and so that I can use it instantly. Banking system says opposite. Sometimes a big amount cash from an unknown bank will be held for 3-5 business days in order to be verified. While being surprised still, I took the check to the counter and asked if I can deposit it to my account. That's when I found out that this is a trap. The lawyer did a great job of identifying it as such and told me that she has to talk to her manager about it immediately. Soon enough, the manager came to me and asked me how I received the check. I explained and the manager confirmed it is part of a plan. However, to be certain the manager returned the letter and the request to their compliance department for more information.  The other red flag I found was the phone number. The phone number given in the email, on the Word Documents and the southgatecons.com website is actually from a Cash Store in Guelph Ontario. What does a construction company have to do with a Cash Store?

Red Flags To Consider Getting E-mail From This Site: - No Initial face to face or virtual video conference meeting to go over the resume and qualifications, - Initial questions related to what I would be doing were not answered or clear, which questions the entire's integrity. - Interviewer wanted a professional photo / portrait / video of the applicant during the initial very vague , e-mail interview request  which would be included in a requested and written , ten day labor agreement request  and "application form" with a required signature from the applicant. Both the signature of the employer on the form didn't match what was on the website or the domain of information  and  the signature itself didn't match the actual name of the person that  also signed it. 2017  - Origin of domain was created May of 2017 when it was said the company was in business since 2003 - Origin of domain doesn't match the name / CEO / president on the bottom of th agreement or date - Origin of domain email was a third party g-mail account - Suite 900 on your address leads to a different company - Wanted to transfer funds through email and later to transfer funds with credit card for identification - The IT Consulting was not a Fintech awards finalist in 2017 which was displayed on their website. This information was checked on Fintech's website which give out awards in Australia not Montreal / Quebec. - Contact Information phone Number (226)-400-5757 - Traced To Facebook as "Travel," and all you get is a fake message - Claims to have two physical addresses: These are FAKE addresses and Fake Contact Number on the main page traced to Brantford, Ontario. -  36600 Ave, Saint-Laurent, du8 - 1665 N Waterton, Wisconsin, Milwaukee, 53202

Was hired, did 2 weeks of work, then website disappeared + contact person unknown + never got paid.
I was hired by this guy to do masonry work for 20 dollars an hour. I worked for 2 weeks and never got paid a cent. He basically told me to take him to small claims court which would cost me more in the long run..so basically I could screw myself. He cuts so many corners on the job and draws customers out of thousands, charging them for random extra work that he claims was necessary, yet he never even did. I've heard several guys complain about his pay ethics. He continues to go online and hire young men, getting them to work as much as he can before he ultimately tips them off. Knowing that they typically are students or low income young people who have no means to battle him in court over a few hundred dollars. He continues to operate this way as of this writing.
I was Contacted by email with a job offer and asked to fill out 2 documents to accept the position. They said their office is located in London but that they are opening an office in my city in the next month
I was offered a job by email after my resume was found on the job search website indeed by their PR team. The second email said that I would be on a 30 day paid probation period after the documents they asked me to fill out were received and a background check completed. The previous email stated that due to the company working with students and government issued programs I needed to have a clean criminal record, but the was no documents sent for that check, none of the documents asked for my social insurance number, so I have no indication that they were planning to pay me. I called the number provided in the email to ask questions, the person who called me answered and when I asked about the documents sent to be filled out and said that there was some information missing, she said that I would complete new documents after the 30 day trial was over. The emails I had received stated that they were planning to open an office in my city next month and that was why they were offering me a job, I questioned that, but they did not know where in Calgary they were opening an office as they had not secured a lease yet. I was then directed to their website to find out more about the company, there was very little information. The social media links don't work and the the #'s don't link to the company. I did a reverse look-up for the last phone number on the site and all I could find is that it is a cell phone # in Saskatoon no other information could be found.
I applied for an Administrative Assistant job posted on Indeed.ca for a company called Denver Winnelson. I got an email from Samantha Fenton of NPE Community saying she is offering me the job without an interview and she responded to my indeed.ca application to Denver Winnelson. She made me a job offer for me to sign but there was no date next to the signatures and there was no start date mentioned in the offer. Their website claims they are a tenant of the Downtown Financial Building in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan with the address of: 230 22nd St E. Ste 205, Saskatoon, SK., Canada. When I contacted the building management for that building, they said they don't have a tenant with the name of North Park Education Community or NPE Community. So from this knowledge, I knew for sure that this company is a fraud. Don't fill out or sign their job offer as they can commit identity theft and other bad things.
I got an email from ALT Equipment Inc saying that there are couple of positions available in their company if I am interested in. I looked at the Pdf, the so called I sent me and I was interested in 'Operations Manager' position. I replied her back saying that I am interested in this position. Then I decided on doing some research: Firstly, I tried some information about the company but could not find anything. Secondly, the Number which was listed in the email I called them up but no response given, address which they gave in the email. I located couple of places around and called them up and asked them if they had any company named as "New Equipment," nearby and they all said "not that they know of" but, I used this http://www.domainwhitepages.com/ to check when was the website created which they sent me. And I saw it was created on 22 May, 2017 by guys..!!!
I used sevendollarclick.com since may 2016 to check their legitimacy and built up a number of cash out requests totaling $245,000 approximately to date I have not received payment and initial emails were replied to with payment is on the way and recent emails were not replied to, I sent an envelope recently which was also ignored. This site feeds you by selling items to enable cash out and simply does not pay the cash out requests.
This was the latest email I received from these people asking for personal information.  The website looks professional.  None of the phone numbers provided work.  When I asked them to speak in person, they kept giving me the run-around, saying they will call me after I do preliminary work, etc.   These people found me through a job hunting site, and asked if I wanted to work with them.  It all sounded too easy. The website looks professional and all, but there are obvious differences (as if English is their second language), the emails are all B.S., it's pretty terrible.  Here is the latest email I received (I've provided this). I never sent them any of my information - they keep pushing me to get started.  Figured you guys (and others) should know about this. Shelton Jobs INC is pleased to welcome you. Thank you for your interest, now you need to provide next information, before you can start probation period: 1 - Carefully read the Free Agreement, and then fill it out. You must print it out, fill it out, scan it back (or take the time on your phone) and send it back. 2 - A scan / picture of any document which verify your identity. (See: Both sides of yours passport, both sides of driving license, both sides of medical card.) We guarantee that all your copies will be protected and confidential.  All customers pass the traffic control  Our security department also check the criminal history and other public records of each applicant. Please provide required documents soon. Please read and fill out the contract carefully. I am looking forward to start work with you together, I believe you will get great experience in our company. Feel free to ask me at any time if you will have any questions.  Please let me know when you will receive this email and the attached document. Else I will see it again.

Only after signing the employment contract, you will be considered by our employee and you will be able to have access to confidential information. All questions related to: work, location, company, etc., you can ask me. Have a nice day. Paula Boyd Chief of Hiring Department of the "ALT Equipment Inc" : (289) 804-2779  http://altequipment.com/   1830 Gage Court, Mississauga, ON, US2  The job application that was attached had the same information that would have been on my resume if they in fact did have a copy of it. The grammar / writing is questionable and I am wanting to warn others not to discuss their personal information.  I am sure that it will only take another couple of emails before they ask for banking information.  The website looks legitimate, however I am unable to find out any information on this company.

A lady named Patricia Tremblay contacted me by e-mail in my local language (French) with a job offer. The job is really well paid (30$/h) and is suppose to be payment management. They said they offer a formation and not to worry about learning the job because somebody will help me for that. I have absolutely no experience in business management or any education in finance. I gave them some already public information like my name, address, references... They never contact my references and three days later they said i had the job, without an interview or any phone/phone talk. At this point, they ask me to fill a work contract and a form for direct reporting my salary in my bank (asking for social number and bank number). I was highly skeptical, so i try to phone Patricia and i had prepared some confusion question for her to answer and to see if she introduced herself. The phone number was not working, no answering machine, no ringing, the call just stop. So i was pretty confident in having them here on foot.
I was contacted by a Mr. "Kevin Halstead", saying he found my job online on the website Indeed. After sending me a number of forms to fill out, none of which asked about my abilities to complete the "tasks" that were supposedly going to pay me 67000 dollars a year. I was suspicious at first, however proceeded with caution until I was absolutely sure. Throughout the emails exchanged I noticed there were a number of grammar mistakes that were abnormal for a small company. I checked the website, it seemed "vague" however did not provide me with much more information about the company as everything was very vague. Finally, once I was "accepted" over many applicants (I did not even apply), I was told I would have a personal banking account to handle business and would be sent an interact email transfer, and in order to do that I would have to give the account holders name (me), my bank institution, and my email address. This I immediately found strange because first of all, for interact transfers my name is not really necessary, nor is the name of where I bank. On top of that, they already had my email address? So I called Mr. Halstead back, saying that it seemed a little strange and I would like to speak to somebody over the phone. He replied back soon enough saying his manager would call me, but also saying welcome to the team... and he didn't really directly answer any of my questions which was also a red flag for me. Finally I received a phone call from the number listed on their website as their "Toronto, Ontario" location. It was also the same number on "Kevin Halstead's" email stamp. However, the phone call was not from him, but from a lady who spoke poor English.  She began to describe to me exactly what the email had said when it was describing my tasks. She said that she was the "reason" and that I would need to send another email if I requested more information about the legitimacy of the company. She said I could speak with a manager if I would like to, however the email said I would receive an email from the manager so I questioned her on that as well. She began to get nervous, and finally when I asked her what her name was she responded "Tiffany" and then proceeded to spell Tiffany for me. This lady on the phone had a thick accent and it was obvious to me her name was not Tiffany. When I asked her last name, she paused for a moment and then said "Sarah". At this point it was over and I began to laugh and say "your name is not funny!!" and then she hung up.
They use an online site for jobs to present an offer : However the company name used was Cummins Eastern Canada Later they contact to me by email asking a few thing, them they sent me a form to fill with my professional profile. After that they call me and do me a short phone interview. Few days later I received by regular mail a job offer with instructions and a check for $4986.85 After I accepted the offer they told me to deposit the check and sent a certification of deposit. I did it on Monday May 8th 2017 Later they ask me sent me a bill for 2999.02 for my training, and said that I have to paid that money from the check that I already received. This payment has to be done by e-transfer to : Name: Personal Safety Email: may2017training@cumminseastern.ca Amount: $2999.02 And they requested a copy of my driver license. I initially did the transfer but I stop it and went to a local branch of Cummins to talk with him, they were busy but the doctors explain me that offer was false and that they will never ask for money during the application, recruitment, or on-boarding process. I went to the local police but they said that they can not don'thing if I didn't lose any money. Then I went to the bank to report the fraud and request that check that I deposited the day before because it was false.
A job posting for an administrative assistant position was posted on Indeed.com A job worker submitted their resume and was advised that they were "short-listed" for a phone interview. Before the interview was scheduled, the person posing as the Hotel Manager asked the candidate to submit answers to interview questions by email. The job holder was advised they were advancing to the next round and asked to provide references and a date they would be able to begin employment. The references were never contacted, but the City Manager then contacted the job manager and advised them that they had gotten the job and an employment letter was to follow. The letter attached was received - clearly raising some red flags. An internet search revealed this scheme has been previously performed using other legitimate company names. The end game appears to be financial gain - the supposed position requires the employee to deposit company funds into their personal bank account. In other instances, the current employer has asked for some or all of the funds to be returned. Once the money is received by the customer, the original check is cancelled, resulting in a personal loss for the employee.
I was contacted by someone on Indeed.com about a job and when I expressed interest, someone called Anne Barton handed me a job description and application form (description attached.) Their website looked suspicious with stock photos of their "staff", so I copied the contents of the job description and it came up as a fairly old story just with a different website.
I was hired by this company offering me a job at there new location in Toronto. I have completed the employment application.

Contacted me for employment. Then wanted me to transfer money. They sent me a contract / sounded like legitimate work but wanted 2200 to be transferred. Below is the communication between myself and the "employer"
Random email from them, I've never applied to the company before. Initial email was as followed: "We offered you a job, but you haven't answered us. We are searching for Executive Service Manager. Please let us know if you are available now so that we could send you additional information. Write me back with a request to see you if you are not interested/available at the moment." There was no job offer prior to this.  I called back asking them to send the information then got the following with 2 texts. The first attachment states that for the entire period I would not receive my salary but only commission (probation period is 5 days long). I would also have to use my personal bank account. "Bank account for work: During the probation period you may need to use your personal bank account. Your account will only be used during the probation period, after passing it you will be provided with a company account. It is recommended to open a new business account for every person that has not yet passed the probation period.

I was offered a administrative assistant position. They mentioned that they were opening a new business in Ottawa. I followed up with their interview questions, all looked so professional until I tried to send my references yesterday as they requested and I got a failure notice and the company number after trying to call was out of service. It looked to me like a professional business growing in recycling cell phones and satellites in other countries while saving their waste. This is a bad company, they got my hopes really high and I worked hard on responding to their questions all to come back as a hero. I am so disappointing! It is hard to find a good decent job today' let alone having to live this situation. 'False hope'.. I hope they are stopped!!!

Then after 2 business days they send you an email back stating you have been approved for a training agreement and send you another form to fill out which requires you to give them your bank information, your drivers license, passport, and health care number.

On completion your performance will be assessed and you will be invited to an interview in our new office. After the interview is finalized, probation (60 days) begins. Your performance during both phases will be commended, please find information in the document attached.

This person representing himself as Lucas Dowie (City Manager) sent me a Offer of Employment for Admnistrative Assistant. It was for a Satellite office being opened here in Ottawa. He said I would meet with the Project Manager a week before starting May 15. In the meantime they would send me a laptop  and  a com to cover office supplies. Upon signing the offer I was to include my full name, address where laptop was to be sent and name of financial institution. I did send any of this however they have a copy of my resume I'm sure from online. After some research on the company and some time signatures and grammar errors it has come to light this is a FRAUD!!!!!!

Enclosed please find copy of the letter, report sheet and check in the amount of $2,980.24 I received from Adams Rogens who contacted us by e-mail and requested my services, as  did Mystery Shopper but  with just little information I provided, copy of emails included as well. A few days later I received said letter with regret, but my husband suggested I do further investigation, as it was very  very funny so  that people will send me a letter in half amount to it to start. I spoke with a good friend of ours and showed him he does. He suggested to return those coins. along with that which you will find copy of my letter addressed to Mr. Adams Rogens. Please take this seriously and investigate, as these people look like they are earning money and using good people like we to do that.

My bank clerk verified the call,and told me it was probably bad. I haven't heard from the family since,it's been a week...

Full translation into Enligh         A few days ago, I received an email from a person working for a company that seems to be looking to fill a position in payment management. I am looking for a job and my curriculum is on several job search sites and I am also with placement agencies to help me. The email mentions that they have seen my curriculum and they have the same position either part time or full time to offer me. Very well paid as well as commission on the work done and a work at home. I would take care of money transfers for their clients, either small or large companies  All by bank transfer. They sent me a PDF document for more details and another questionnaire to my effect, references that I filled out and returned by email. I received an email today telling me, my "design" has passed the pre-selection and I have been approved by the directors of the company. I now have to sign the employment contract as well as to fill out the bank form to be able to deposit my pay, 2 times a month. I did nothing of this. I am not called for an interview. They don't ask me to come to their office or anything. I just had the job like that... I found it strange that the contract of employment was very badly written among other things and that I don't pass any interview and that I don't meet anyone for whom I would work... too good for To be true... I asked in my favour and the majority say not to ask since it seems strange. I did some research on them for this company and apart from their website and the fact that they are registered at the federal level, there is not much. In addition, a Google Maps search gives me a building that does not bear the name of this company at all but another name. And a search with the name of the director has not been very useful except that this man is also the director of the company written on the building. So I will not fill out the contract or the other form. And I was advised to fill out a report with you.

I received an employment offer from Harold Personnel Staffing, Halifax, Nova Scotia. I told them that I am in Ontario currently. They said that we are opening office in your region and would train you for our job. They have asked me to sign some freelance agreement which I have not provided them as yet. They are nowhere to be found on Google or LinkedIn. They have not asked for any financial information from my end as of now. They have asked me to sign the agreement first, which I have not done.
Filled out an application online through the website, business contacted the consumer by email and sent a check to the consumer. They tell the consumer they must cash the check, purchase two different items from two different stores. The consumer would be rewarded afterwards.
Offers you a job but assists you in the process by requesting information a person would normally give to a prospective job. After you fill out an "application" which includes 3 references, they request your banking info. Not a real job offer. Doesn't answer questions, uses broken glass.

I received an email of an instant job offer as an office assistant, of which they claim they reviewed my CV files from their PR department and found me meeting all of their requirements. I didn't particularly remember me applying to this location, but I was trying to find summer employment. Already email, there were countless syntax and grammar errors, even in the quick reply emails there were these errors. After asking me some typical interview questions to respond to (which I did), they immediately asked for documentation for proof of my identity (to see if I wasn't a spy - how ironic) and fill out an employment agreement containing my personal information, excluding sin number. Again, more syntax and grammar errors in the agreement form. Looking at their website (moonstarfin.com), there are even more syntax and grammar errors. Looking at the about us management section, I see pictures of the supposed leaders of the company to which they don't even exist on LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter. I would assume the pictures of these people were fake because their visual ethnicity don't match their names or description of where they're from. They have a news section which in most company websites they are news related to the company. With this news section, they're just random NY Times articles that are completely irrelevant and have no connection to the company. In the contact us section, I try sending them a question to which I never got a reply back to. Then I tried calling the number provided - which is the same number of the number in their contact head, which they don't even have an extension number for either - and all I get is a dial-up dial tone.
I was contacted by an 'employment agency' in Nova Scotia about employment in Calgary with a start up company.  She then dropped out of sight and I was then contacted about 2 weeks later by the noted company.   Flags began to go up when they sent me a 'check' for 4800 to deposit it into my bank account to purchase office supplies.  Bank account 00109 010 400 3rd Avenue, and,2.  The Calgary Office is listed on the site is 324 8t Avenue,1, #2.  I am supposed to meet their Project Manager on March 31 to take a tour of the offices.   The 'check' was sent by UPS Tracking No. 1 - 542 14 1737 5064 from a.G postal address.  250 King Street Toronto although all correspondence had been from 60 Grand Lake Ct, Canada,,9.
I received text message in regards to performing surveys for money. I responded for more information giving them my name and address only and they said check and instructions were being passed to me as I was selected as a mystery suspect. I text them again and asked for more information about company and business licence # to verify they were a legitimate business. I didn't here anything back but did receive a check for $ 2970 and instructions in mail for 21/17. They tell me to deposit them and keep certain amount in account and then call phone number. I'm also to conduct a survey of on the Bank and Walmart (sheet and questions provided). I haven't nor do I intend to complete either of these instructions. I need company name on check and it is a Taxi company in Ottawa (                         ), not sure if they know their name is being used on checks for Survey company?
I was offered Administrative Assistant role.  1. they interviewed me for 6 minutes, they only asked me about my last job position. They never asked me if I know anything about their type of business or their company.  2. I was offered job within a week (whole process took 4-5 days).  3. I read news article explaining this is a dream so I did not fall for it. But I would like to scare all the info I have.  4. When I asked them if they can pay me per project or per assignment completed. They did not know what to say to me so they cut ties.  6. They told me they will open office in two months time in Mississauga.  7. They told me I will have 1 month probation $35/hour. After probation $38/-. They said I will have dental and insurance. But contract is not specific enough. It'not specify how much coverage I will have. OR up to what amount.  8. They asked me to keep in touch with them over TELEGRAM and Email. I was asked to download TELEGRAM on my phone and computer.  9. I was asked to report when I am starting work (9am) and when I am going on lunch or any breaks and when I am done work. ALL reports were done over TELEGRAM. I only worked today. and I never sent them my research because I saw more information about them in the news article. IT WAS BY MISTAKE TOO. Their website was down for 5 minutes and I tried to go on their website just before I finished my "day of work" and I could not find their website so I tried to close it and that is when I saw new report.  I sent Genius Associaiton numerous emails (over the weekend, between my 1st day of work and potential 2nd day of work). AND no one replied. Lady only called me to tell me she will look into my emails and she never got back to me.  SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO ME.  - I confronted her about her son.  I spoke on the phone with her about it and she answered and was very surprised.

My father in law was offered a job as an Administrative Assistant for Genius Association, making $35/hour to start, increasing to $38/hour after the training period.  The email stated they were planning to open an additional office in Edmonton in a couple of months, which is where my father in law lives.  The job description was fairly broad and we were not sure about what the company did, as we could not find out one thing about them online.  They claimed to do some sort of student exchange programs and finding host families for exchange students as well as research on your demographic area.  The email was weird, it raised a bunch of red flags:  1. The company did not have a www. address, only a page online.  Could not be there etc.  2. Offered the position with no interview, phone call etc.  3. High pay for an administrative Assistant  4. The personal interview was to be held after the trial period of 4 weeks  5. Another single page on the web with no www. explaining the position  6. At the bottom of the job offer letter, it said something about "Office Administrator at Baycrest Hospital, Edmonton".. which there is no hospital in Edmonton named that.  I have other things that I tried to attach however this only lets you attach one.  I also have their Direct Deposit form, and their Registration form.
Received email telling me I was shortlisted for administrative assistant position which pays $2106.00 bi-weekly. He said he found my resume on mbjobcentre.ca. After  repeated emails back and forth, he said I got the job.  I looked up website and it looked good, but after looking a little further, I saw that this same card was listed under a  Fraud website. They make you answer 4 questions (kind of interview) through email and NEVER call you, until you accept the "job offer".  And once this person who calls himself "Tony Cheng", calls, it sounds like a cell phone, as it cuts in and out. Not sure what they are after, but I stopped it before it went further.
I was told that I have been selected for employment as an IT specialist....and to proceed my passport info is needed....and another piece of ID.....they claim that offices will be open in Toronto( I was hired for)...but it does not exits. Our conversation for this position has been going on for over a few weeks.
Hello, I applied for a job with Meda AB and was contacted immediately by email about an interview through some chat. I added the email address and proceeded with the interview. His name was David.  When I asked questions at the end they were silent. I was asked to be back on the about the following day at 8am.  I did so but stated before we went any further I want to meet with the Seattle area supervisor. I was told I would meet the person the following day.  I was then contacted, via text, by another individual saying how great the company was and how much she made etc. ( the initial person then stopped being me). Her name was Kelly. I started asking questions to Kelly and she was reluctant to answer them. I asked where David was and she stated he was in a seminar.  I asked more questions and she stopped kissing me back.  that was March 15/17. On March 16/17 I sent him a text message stating I would not consider employment for varying reasons. He did not respond and I have not received anything since. With the recent cases going on I though the world should know about this.
They called me telling me i was the perfect candidate for this job offer. They pay high, 30$ an hour which is what caught my eye. They explained i only had to fill out forms and i could get the job if i qualify. They called back saying i got the job and they wanted all my bank information as well as a lot of different questions about my banking such as how often i can take money out, how much at a time and how often i use my bank, etc. They did not do any interviews and they 'n't answer about a location spot. Nothing comes up online about their business either.

- Called me and offered a job. - No experienced required (even though I have experiences in the field) - Hired me with no personal interviews, only emails with questions. - Need to "pass probation period" - On first day of probation period: Company provides work email with password and give details and information to post jobs on indeed.ca as third-party ad agencies typically do. - Then asked for Name, Bank name, and E-transfer email, then told "funds" would be deposited and provided to me in order to post jobs on paid job sites, then sent another email explaining how it will be used for next day of work. - I went back on indeed.ca as this ordeal now seems suspicious, the work email account I have been using to post jobs in indeed.ca is already disabled (within an hour). - Searched the domain of Google's website  website was created on / 13/2017 even though the "company" was founded in 2006. - Searched business name in bbb.org, no such company exist.
Letter was obtained from the U.K. # 307. It is important to realize that she is a legitimate company but baosteelchina is not! Note the email address ends with baosteelchina.com but if you type baosteelchina.com, no page appears. This show is about a job opportunity for an initial $2,000 per month and of course, they start with asking you to give fairly "innocent" personal details. They also use the logo of the "real" parent company. Don't waste a moment of your time on this.
Over the last 3 weeks I have been communicating with a Kyle William  claiming to be part of  Deer Park Spring Water's Canadian Auto Wrap Advertisement program. I thought I was signing up to to have my car wrapped in Deer Park Water advertising and get paid a weekly rent for this service. I received a check for payment it did not have the company name attached to it  and  it was for a large amount of money supposedly to pay a specialized technician to come wrap my car. I have attached copies of the letter  and  up I received for your reference.
They contact me by email and later by phone, offering a very attractive pay rate, The person was Hellen Pettingill. they didn't ask for my account number and when I asked how they will pay they say by check, which never happen to me before. They ask me to start with a project and working by internet tracking my times by telephone, when I was looking the website by Google, I didn't find anything, nothing related with them, when I look for the phone number in internet I found an alert of mine, I investigate in Saskatchewan and it is a local company. be careful, the offer is too good to be true.  The website that send her my resume was closed.
I previously reported employment fraud and have today received confirmation of fraud.  The employment fraud started with a job posting for an  office /administrative Assistant,  r  for a supposedly architectural firm who was opening a satellite office in my location of Killeen, TX. The name of the parent company was The Nova Scotia Construction, LTD ,  located in Halifax, NS, Canada.  The job posting was posted on Indeed.com and that is how my e-mail communications started:  by applying for this position starting with submission through Indeed.com. Later I was contacted by e-mail by a Louise Sutherland and her associate, a Jason Davalos  and  when I checked out the company on-line .  it appeared they had a company web-site with record of projects. Communications via the internet (e-mail) started in mid-late January, 2017  and  and I ceased communicating with them when I suspected fraud.  In the interim I sent out messages through the Halifax Chamber of Commerce, and also the Dallas Canadian Consulate as well as the International (Canadian-linked) trade commission. Today I received the attached e-mail advising me to alert law enforcement officials. When I entered the fraud with the U.S.National Better Business Bureau  and  it appeared that the US National BBB may already have some sort of information ,  linking this type of government employment with military members or employees of military or retired military men.
I was contacted through phone for a medical imaging and coding job. I was made a job agreement and then given instructions to contact the hiring manager on Google Hangouts. A Mr Christopher Garrison with the email ranbaxypharmaciticalinc@chemist.com. From there I was contacted by a Mr John Wash joshuawash99@gmail.com who informed me that their accountant needs my bank account information including my online access name and password in order to screen shot the deposit of funds.

I researched about their website and discovered it was created less than one month ago, by a company in London, UK. Researching more about them, I discovered it was fraud, so I finished any contact with this company.
I have received an a-mail from what seems to be a company looking to employ. They first asked about the name phone number and the CV. I initially sent the book because I have published my CV since I am searching for a job. 2 days later, I received and email and what seemed to be a signed contract.

As I was looking for work, I can across an add that looked applicable to me, so I send them my resume. They got back to me a few days later, inviting me to an interview on local news the next morning. The interview itself seemed fine but after it was over, they said they had to go over my answers to proceed. After about 45 minutes, they told me I was hired and training would start the next day. The next day, the person I was chatting with asked me two questions and answered two questions I had Amongst other things, they told me that while the company was thriving, they plan to open an office in Canada within 6 months. It took about 50 minutes all in all, because the person had to refer to specific departments in the company for answers. The day after that, we met online again, same time. He asked me to sign the employee contract he'd send me, which I did. I was now an 'official employee of mine'. Note that he had so far not asked me for my social insurance number or bank information, other than which bank I am with. A day later, they told me they send me a. so I could buy some office supplies. Three days later the police arrived. As I was not home, I found it on my front step. It seemed kind of strange to me that they would send me money and then  not make me sign for receiving it. I opened the envelope and in it was a rather large check ($2,750). It seemed like a lot to me. I also noted that the company on the envelope wasn't Green but Forever Green Inc. The company name on the card was yet another name: Dreamtec Global Inc. So I had three different company names for this one job I was supposed to have. As soon as I told the persons I got the check, he asked me how far away my bank is, where the nearest bank would be, how long it would take for the money to be deposited into my account. I got suspicious after I told him I could deposit it with online banking and he had to talk to the accounting department whether that was acceptable. At this point, I decided to go to the bank to make sure it was empty. My personal bank told me almost right away that it looked like a bank check. They contacted the bank on the phone to ask for information on the company that was on the phone. As they were waiting to hear back, I went to the bank mentioned on the phone. They said the bank didn't know they company and that I could either send the check back or rip it up. The police (where we went after all this) informed us that we could make a report online, but that they wouldn't be able to do much, because that's just the nature of crime. As soon as you're on to them, they change.
E-mail several times, by a (supposed) woman named Ariana Muscente, to offer job opportunity of Payment Program Manager for $35/hour. Asked me to send a photo of myself as well as to fill out a (poorly written) employment agreement form. I was then contacted by a male (unknown identity) to confirm that cash transactions would need to take place in my bank account during a 10-day trial period. I outright denied to do this and was never contacted again.
Business is not yet accredited. Recruiter advised lady not to give information on company as every company has negative complaints, just look up ABC prime time and go to scholar.google.com. Listened to call where individual "recruiting" for their Pyramid team took advantage of a senior who really is concerned about trying to keep her youthful appearance. The start up kit is reasonably priced, commission made on it is cheap yet they kept pushing it on the poor lady. Wonder how many other female senior citizens they have talked into trying to sell this very anti-aging product...yes the product is good, but over priced! (quote from "recruiter"-people are willing to pay anything to stay young and youthful in appearance)
The company goes through employment websites and contacts individuals with messages posted. They offer what seems to be an honest job offer. You start your training, the server supposedly goes down, and you can't contact anyone again. They then tap into your emails, and using information they gather from your email account they then attempt to transfer money out of your bank account.

Takes cash money. Press new customers into getting a job by telling them he has a job and actually never setting up anything. He can't even get an interview set up and when you ask for money back he disappears and never get back to you. I suggest to stay away from him. He is a farmer.
ThePayPay.com (original site name was: TheInviteClub.com) Layout of advertisement and committed membership qualifications are exact same, just the members got cut off and never paid out! One account made them about $500 and all of a sudden, finally, their website name changed from TheInviteClub.com to ThePayPay.com, and never delivered the account to its members!! Their system tops it off with confirmation once you hit a certain amount (usually $300), you will be asked via survey centre (which never accepts any of your completed forms yet), and apparently you can get paid out. NOT! All it is is to take your personal information and sell it on the black market. Yes!! ThePayPay.com IS NOT GO AND IS A SCAM 150%!!!!!
This company contacted me said they got my details from a job site,they said they do mystery people, they sent me a check for $1,492.34 and told me to deposit the check and withdraw $1000 the rest would be mine once I completed a task,then said once I have the $1000 to call then back and they would tell me what to do. But I didn't want to cash the check as I think it's a scam.i tried finding out on the net anything I could about the company but can't find anything.

I came across this company as a means as making some money part time at home. Upon receiving an "employment agreement" I found it odd that a mining company had "state" and "tax code"  on the agreement. Upon further looking into it I found that there had been other emails from this company. They only have my basic information (full name, birthday etc.) yet it still makes me very angry that people would take advantage of others like that. Anyone that is contacted by this company absolutely ignore them, they aren't real!

Emilie Burns , Manager  Future Web Media  5700 York St #200,  North York ON M2M 4K2  hr@futurewebmedia.net  futurewebmedia.net  (2014-4277 "  The Labour Agreement basically just repeated the job duties and hours. I signed my name on it, and sent it back. After this "he" stopped responding. I noticed that the signature at the bottom of the Labour Agreement was for "John Krasner", but the actual signature looked nothing like that, it looked like it started with an H and had an L in it. So I got suspicious and started researching the company. However the address, and a bunch of different companies all list 5700 York St #200, North York ON M2M 4K2 as their address. For example: Yorkey-Investigations Inc., DocsBase Certified Translation Agency, ADR Mediation Network, Ease  and  Strength Massage, Location of Life Pathways Psychotherapy, etc. and a lot more. I couldn't find anyone by the name of Emilie Burns or John Krasner that had anything to do with the company. The company has no social media pages. It seems to be owned by Seyed Ali Mirabolghasemi. The company website www.futurewebmedia.inc shows that they have another location in Australia. Location : 958 Way, Perth, WA 6001 Australia. I called Future Web Media Inc. to see when/if it was registered and this came up, with an address that doesn't match:  "The Future Web Media Inc. was incorporated on Monday 17th May 2010, so the company age is six years and seven months. The company registration status is Active.Future Web Media Inc. register address is 7368 Yonge St., Suite#: 311, Thornhill (area code: 401). The company's country of origin is CA. "  I figured it was a trap so I e-mail "Emily" and told her the address she gave me doesn't match the search results on Google. She responded:  "It's our address.  Congratulations! You have accepted for a trial period on the Online Service manager position.  We have chosen you out of a certain number of candidates for this position, and we hope that you will not let us down.  You are familiar with your responsibilities and ready to get to work.  You should check your e-mail constantly and respond to my messages quickly.  Just keep your cell phone available to get a call from us at all times.  Many organizations are required to produce accounting documents about their activity. Using it allows you to offer  the highest level of transparency since you can provide information your members can use to verify your services and transactions.  Bitcoin is an emerging market of new customers who are searching for ways to spend their income. Accepting them is a good way  to get new customers and give your business some new visibility. Accepting a new payment method has often shown to be a clever  practice for online businesses.  To start working with Bitcoin, you need to fill up your wallet. We will give you money via that system.  To do this, we need to know:  Your Holder name:  Your Bank branch name:  Your Email address associated with account:  Your phone number:  There is no fee to receive this, and many will let you control how large a fee to pay when spending.  Most banks have reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster confirmation of your transactions.  Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it's possible to send 100,000 coins for the same fee it costs to send 1 billion.  After receiving electronic transfer, you will have to fill up your own wallet. (DURING AN HOUR AND A HALF)  We will send you 2-3 transactions through that system.  Have you ever used electronic transfer (IT)?  Do you have online banking active?  Your duty will be to:  - Contact the customer   - Take his order   - Analyze order   - Contact the seller (our partner)   - Report the order value to the customer.  After that you will contact with the customer and give him all the details of his order.  (Including delivery time in client's region).  You must ensure all necessary tasks for the client. You should find an individual approach to each customer.  You should offer new services and products to him.  In other words, your position requires you to do everything possible, to make client happy.  For the future, he will work with us and recommend our company to others.  You need to understand your customer, how to do it:  Providing a high level of customer care often requires you to find out what your customers want.  Once you have identified your most valuable customers or best potential customers,  you can target your highest levels of customer care towards them.  You should collect information about your customer.  Information about your customer and what he wants is available from many sources, including:  - His order history  - Records of their contacts with our business - phone calls, meetings and so on  - Direct feedback - if you ask them, customers will usually tell you what they want  - Changes in the overall success of specific products or services  - Feedback about your existing range - what it does and does not do  - Reports about possible new products or services  - Feedback from your customers about things they buy from other businesses  - Feedback and orders from other, non-competitive suppliers.  It may sound hard, and sometimes it is not clear to you. Do not worry, I'll be in charge of  you throughout the 10 days. I will give detailed instructions step by step.

I've attached the Labour Agreement I was sent. Notice how the signature doesn't match the name, and at the top in the greeting the words "Future Web Media" look mixed in. Hope all this helps!
I was rewarded with a job opportunity as an administrative assistant. No one called me they just offered me the job after a couple emails. They said they were setting up a satellite office in Winnipeg Manitoba. I did request a call from them. They did call me but I could barely make out the man. They said they would be sending me a check for office supplies. After doing some research and talking to friends, I found out that this type of thing is a dream.
They offered me a job where they will send me e-transfers to my personal bank account
Someone named April Boling called me saying they got my resume from me for a job that was adding jobs to job site. I've applied to many work-from-home jobs so I didn't think it was that weird that they found my resume on some site. They sent me a contract to sign and (strangely) included a picture of my driver's license. I actually went online before doing any of this and called "ane + +" and found nothing. So I continued with the "application" and added a test job to Indeed.ca. Then they wanted me to use money they were going to send me to buy Bitcoins, which is where the big red flag came up as I didn't see how or why Bitcoins were needed to add jobs to job sites. This was about a week later, so I randomly decided to use their name plus name again, and this time I found some reports saying the same thing. They're starting a real company called Apikan Consulting in Quebec, even using the same street address.  The real company now has a warning on their site, apikan.ca, saying that any random emails from them is a risk. They even texted me once asking me why haven't I done work yet from a number with a California area code: 442-226-4957. They were very busy calling me and calling me repeatedly if I didn't respond to their emails within 5 minutes.
They work under the name of an employer on employment websites then contact you about a possible job.
I received an e-mail saying that i could make $297 - $323 per day working only 2-3 hours a day part time and that they are looking for 100 members in each state. In trying to prove that it wasn't a dream, they provided a website address. I've never even heard of the company so I did some research and the only thing coming up was that it was a bank.
This name came to me in a few as advertising employment as a mystery writer. I had failed to him and had correspondence with the providers of this scheme in hope to gain employment. I was then only asked very basic questions name, address email. No other info. Then I was sent a large check and was told to take 400$ as payment and that I would ( once part of the check was confirmed) then have more instructions to follow. I deposited the check it bounced a week later to g back a lot and stolen apparently.

Currently, Project Coordinator Compass On May 7, 2016, at 06:32, Prorecruiters Magazine  wrote: Thanks for your swift respond and I am glad you are interest in learning more about our car advertisement program. Car wrap advertising is the marketing practice of completely or partially covering a vehicle with an advertisement or livery, thus turning it into a mobile brand. This can be achieved by simply painting the vehicle surface, but it is becoming more common and professional today to use large vinyl sheets as well.  It can be removed with relative ease, making it much less expensive to change from one advertisement to another. Vehicles with large, flat surfaces, such as Truck, Bus, and Sedan are easy to work with, though smaller cars with curved surfaces can also be wrapped in this manner. Wrap advertising is available to anybody interested of the vehicle you drive, make, make and model of your car.  You car race does not stop you from studying for this program.

If after the first 20 or 40 weeks you want to continue this program, we can re-register or leave you for another 20 or 40 weeks as you desire. THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT DAMAGES:- New technology age has brought lots of improvement in terms of research, production and installation process to lots of products. The foil wrap doesn't damage the paint of any car. We have the latest tech materials suitable with various kinds of our yearly weather.  This new tech will be installed and removed by our approved wrap expert once the contract is approved or when it arrives. PROFESSIONAL INSTALLERS:- We will not take chances with anyone or any local contractor to do the wrapping as your vehicle is precious to us and we require a standard and attractive ad, so we will be responsible for installation and removal of the wrap to avoid any sort of damages to you vehicle but should anything occur we will fully be responsible for any damages.

William Troung recalled me offering me work in the form of a wedding gig (I'm a freelance musician). The plan consisted in him sending me a check and me sending cash to the wedding and before paying the check, I have received the check which of course I haven't tried to cash and would like to now what to do next.
They offered me a job that i donot remember applying to. They said that they found my profile on a website and i have a few profiles for employment purposes. They made me sign a labor agreement and even called me this morning confirming details. They didnot ask for any personal information so i thought maybe that's part of the hiring process. Next thing i knew they were already starting my "trial period" and had me do the first task which was to withdraw money that they transferred to me and deposit it to a certain bank. I thought okay it's their money so i thought there was no harm in doing the "task." As i was doing it, i approached a lady working in the pub where the lady was to ask for help in using the car since it was my first time. She asked me what it was for and i told her it was for my boss. She then told me that it seemed familiar and we ended up talking about it being a possible name. She showed me emails she received from a different person and company but seemed like had the same ideas. I had already deposited the whole amount in the bank and reported it back to my supposedly boss. He said he was goingna send me my next task but i havenot receive any email from them yet. I donot know what to do im desperately seeking for a job and i think that i fell into an employment camp because of that. Im taking a version of one of the emails i received. I didnot lose any money but somebody else might have.

The above contacted me as an employer who found my resume on the Internet (through Indeed.com) and offered me a job with very high salary and wanted me to provide my ID documents and to sign a contract without even asking me to come for an interview. When I called the number from the email I found out it is suspended due to a suspected gambling activity!
I was contacted about an employer interested in my resume from Indeed.ca.  I allowed them to view my resume and received a return email.  Both emails have minor technical errors for a job which could potentially pay up to six figures and is salary I find this to be strange. The phone number given for the business is not operational in the sense that I can never get through and they request an email instead.
Tapp Consulting Services called me offering an offer of employment for a freelance writer. I tried to search this company to find out reviews as well as more information. I found that this company had a company profile on the Government of Canada's website (which has now since been removed thanks to myself finding them). Tapp Consulting Services required a scanned copy of an I.D. (passport, driver's license, or health card) before employment officially started. I scanned them a copy of my health card to them and they gave me my first job task. I recalled the "senior manager" there saying how I wanted to terminate my employment since I didn't know too much about the company. I did not hear back from them after this point. Government of Canada has also checked to see if this company is still in business and they are not. Tapp Consulting Services now has a scanned copy of my health card and I'm disappointed with the fact that Government of Canada approved their profile description.
Best Version Media has a lot of job openings out there.  I inquired about a job listed in my rural area of NS. Talked to two people on 2 separate occasions (not much info was given) and was told that they thought I was a good fit. I was told I would have to make my way to Toronto for 2 day training (approx $1500 expense to me). Before committing to this, I asked about the territory I would have and about how they determined it was a viable area for a new magazine. I asked for contact information for other publishers in NS, or in Canada to discuss the opportunity in detail. They said they were going to get back to me with some real things (territory, other publishers, etc),  but now have stopped communicating with me. I am concerned that they will get people to training, do a "pitch" and in the end offer no real "employment". It is a business venture at best - only viable for larger centers (20,000 people or more), but they are attractive for people to start up in really small towns and villages (2,000-4,000). People are getting ripped, potentially ripped off..
Offer for a job doing "data entry" at home with rather large, fast paying salary and very vague job description. The website looks like it took 5 minutes to make, has vague information about what it does, and the WHOIS shows that the company is based out of Australia (see https://www.scamwarners.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10 and3). The addresses indicated don't have unit #'s either despite the building indicated at the address having multiple units. "Tina Williams" the "house manager", does not provide any phone number with her email signatures. After doing a fake phone interview where "Tina Williams" claims that she's having technical difficulties and cannot do the video interview until IT sorts it out. During the game on Skype it is very apparent that "she" is using auto-type using a certain script. Despite not having an interview they still "offer" you a high-paying job without describing what it is exactly, and will demand that you use their equipment. She will then claim that they cannot transfer the money from Canada and that they will have to forward you the money, some $1500, so that you have to send the money through your bank via Western Union to Prague, Czech Republic. Again, no explanation is provided, the "company" is seemingly trusting you with a large sum of money to send to you to get "office equipment" 2 days later. Basically you act as a fake circus man. I can provide the emails sent to me by the staff if you wish, in order to provide you with more detail. Also note that the postal address they use is the following: 170 Water Street North, Cambridge, ON, NY6
On December 7, I received an email from hr@mtycinvestment.ca (Manuela Lorenz) saying that she's an IT Assistant in The INVESTMENT SA company. She said, she received my resume from their recruiting agency the Monster website. Since it is true that I have an account with Monster.Ca (and other job sites, because I am currently looking for a job), I thought it could be an opportunity. They were saying, the company is originally in Switzerland and is opening their Canada office this coming December 22 at 160 Quarry Park Blvd. They sent PDF files for the Company Profile, Job Description and Employment Application Form. I folded-up the form and sent back to her. She said, Mr. Thomas Winter (their Development Manager of The North America's department) will contact me within a couple of days if they find me suitable for the position (Alternative Investment's Support). Then this afternoon, I received an email from Mr. Winter (thomaswinter@mtycinvestment.ca), saying he is considering me for the said position. He sent a PDF file (Training Agreement-which now I need to provide my Bank details, please see attachment for more details).
 I am wondering if this company (brownconstructionscompany) are a legitimate company since I received a email from Brown,William in respect to a job working in Canada to represent this company as an agent to look after its operations in this area. However, I'm wondering if this is a reliable company and legitimate in hiring someone to look after their job as a company agent for this Area? Can you help me in this regard? Thank you   ,   .

I initially received an email about my resume being found on a job website and offered me a job as a shop inspector or mystery worker. I said I was interested in the job and got a call asking simple questions including if I had been employed before. After the call, I got another email with a contract I had to fill out and send back and that I had two days to comply or else they wouldn't hire me as an employee. They called each job a "task" and said before I would be fired I had to complete a test task. The test task was to visit a Bitcoin ATM and check to see if it worked, what condition the machine was in, and if there were instructions on how to use it. I sent back my report on the machine and was told that I would start work the next day. The first job was to receive $1455 to my bank account and cash out $1380 of it, put that money into the ticket machine I visited the day before, and fill out another report form. The remaining $75 was to be my commission for completing the task. I did what they asked, sent in my report, and waited to hear about what task I would be doing next. They sent me a job to go to another little bar and do the same thing there. I told them that I would not cash out over $1000 twice in one day and they said they would send me the $1000 and cash out $920 for the remaining $80 was to be my commission. There was an error with the money transfer to my bank account and alerted them of the problem and was told they would fix it. I didn't hear from them until the next day and was told to send them my bank card number to complete the money transfer. I replied that I was not sending them my card number as the account number should be more than enough. They insisted they needed it as the task was to be completed that day. I asked to be sent another task to do and was denied as the other task had been given to someone else and that I would have more tasks the next day. They never contacted me again. I sent them emails for a couple days asking if there were any jobs to do. Still no reply. I then looked up to see if this was a regular thing and turned out it wasn't and that they were trying to scare me. Luckily the funds that had been sent to me were by an e-transfer and they could not void the money that was given to me which was what I was most worried about as I would've had to pay back the bank all the money I had received.

First they contact you through email saying that they found your resume through Indeed. Second they say that they are from Italy, offering an "Accounts Assistant" job. In this job description it states that "We sometimes  have  customers,  we  owe funds and  pay  in financial  instruments  available  only  in the  local  area.  Since  we  work  all  over  the  world,  it  is  much  easier  for  our  accountant  to  transfer money  to  our  Accounts  Assistant  who  are  in  the  same  area.

got offered fake job, everything looked real. I did few projects for them. The company never paid me. They sent me 2 email transfers one was 2000 and one was 1600. They told me take out the cash and send it to other person account. They told me this money is for the housing for students and this money is going to landlord for housing. I said OK. I trusted them. Bank called me yesterday this money was stolen from someone else. They are doing Money shopping.
Recruits you to be a shop inspector. Phone interview then they send a contract for you to sign. They email you a test assignment, then once completed they ask for your Bank name and card number and interact e-transfer account.
I recently posted my information on Indeed.com looking for new jobs.  Some customers reached out to me via email with job opportunities.  I thought I was responding for an Office Assistant position.  They soon upgraded me to "Alternative Investment's Support".  They asked for my banking information and references for the training, which was a bit suspicious since I had yet to talk to someone.  Once we proceed to the 'training phase' they e-transferred me a sum of money to deposit into a account.  They said I could keep a small amount of the money.  I felt very uncomfortable with this whole experience.  I am not sure if they are making money or are a legitimate business or not.  They said they are opening a Vancouver office at 701 George Street on December 8.  I am just hoping to know if they are a legitimate business or not and I hope that no one else gets forced into doing this type of training.  It seems so very suspicious the way they are proceeding with things. I am planning on not pursuing any further with this and will pursue other job opportunities I know are safe.
I paid $997.00 USD for a directory listing with this company, based on their claim of having a contract in place that would give me access to serve thousands of clients as of August 1, 2016 (later changed by them to September 6, 2016) and that I would be paid $100.00 USD per session. In exchange, I was required by law to create a listing, get certified in their technique (mandatory), and serve a minimum of 9 clients per week.  They failed to provide the required certification and the contract/clients by August 1st or September 6th, resulting in a breach of contract.  As of the end of December 2016, there are still no clients/contract as promised. Requests for funds have been refused. I have information that leads me to believe they don't have the contract they say they have. They use this alleged contract to get professionals to sign on and pay $10000, yet they refuse to show the contract to those who have joined. In addition to failing to provide the services paid for, this is looking like it could be a pyramid scheme. They have been getting coaches to recruit new coaches for a 10% annual fee. The number who have joined keeps growing, yet the promised clients/contract has never been opened, hence the only people making money are the ones at the top.
I was contacted via text message about secret shopping.Then email after is said ok. I didn't get any red flags at this time when I filled out some info. (I did leave out some). After I sent it back. I didn't get a reply, which I thought was strange. I then instantly called back telling them I wasn't interested anymore. Today (11/25/16) 4 days after the email. I received a letter and a check in the mail. (Reserve for $2,970.00). I am supposed to call someone once I get the chance to receive further instruction at the number above.

Nothing to do with secret shopping. I don't intend on calling any number or email. I simply want others to be aware.

I had replied to an email that my wife had got about a company looking for mystery ships in my region. about a week after i had first contacted them they replied saying that i was accepted as a mystery writer.  i just had to give them my name and address to get started. another week or so went by then i got a letter in the mail with a note enclosed and my instructions were to deposit 500 of it in my account and take 2490 and deposit it in another account I have yet to get that account number because this is as far as i have got and now I'm really nervous. I think I may have been. and I have already signed the check because when i went to the bank and asked i had 2 other people inform me that it was a legitimate check which made me think that it wasnot a deal at first until I called her. Alex Rogers and he wanted me to deposit so much of it into another account. from the research i have just done mystery the companies donot ask you to deposit funds in any other accounts.
This company reached out to me and offered me a position as a Mystery Writer.  The first task they asked me to perform was they asked me to deposit funds into a Bitcoin ATM.  I tried calling the phone number on their website and the number was out of service.  The person who called me from a toll free number, her name was Amanda Brown and I had difficulty understanding her because of her accent.  Then when I questioned the validity of their company, she couldn't answer any of my questions.  She kept asking me to talk to her manager John Harison.  However, they don't work in the same office nor could she transfer me to speak to you.  I'm not too sure what their intentions are but they are definitely not a legitimate company.  Their website was created 2016 when the company claims they have been in business since 2008.
An email is sent offering employment and  asking personal details. An offer of employment is given  and asking bank accounts and among others. I actually called the FBI to authenticate but does not exist. It has to stop to avoid others to be noticed.
After applying for a permanent position on Indeed Jobs for Microsoft, I was contacted via email. After a seemingly normal hiring process, "Helena Anderson" informed me that the last step was a phone interview. I was told I was hired in the next email. I asked why they didn't do a phone interview. My question was ignored. I was told that I had five days of probation/training tasks. The first "task" was really suspect. It involved them requesting I accept a transfer of  a large sum of money and "spend" or "do" stuff with it in various locations around Calgary. At this time, I started noticing that many of the emails contained grammar errors that a professional company would have screened out. I was also unable to find ANY proof of a Calgary location for Pairsoft Solutions and Helena told me it was being "renovated" and that I would be working there "soon." And this company also pulls up no relevant results, leading me to think they deliberately hide their website from search engines. They do have my personal information, including my address, a picture of my driver's license,  and  a small amount of banking info (they said they pay employees via transfer before asking me to do "training"). I declined the job offer, so I don't know what other "tasks" they wanted--but it's clear that none of what they asked me to do was relevant to the job offer and seemed illegal.
There was a job posting referring to Administration assistant position. I applied for it and I was told I got the job. There story kept changing as I would talk to this Sam Peters more frequent. I was suppose to receive A lap top, check to buy office supplies and a credit card to help them prepare to open the so called new location that they were opening up On July 8th 2016 in Ottawa,Ontario and is now pushed to July 16th 2016. I started getting suspicious when they kept holding off on sending things to me and the fact that this Sam Peter's kept repeating himself and asking me the same questions. referring to ( It's all good? We good to go?) and the phone numbers that were coming in were all different (All in the GTA area). Yesterday I received a check from them to get office supplies. How ever the check comes from a total different company called Logen Corporation. I looked it up and it is a large security company. I want to report this as I believe the Logen Corporation wouldn't give me a check for $4500.00 to spend on another companies supplies. I am in the process of confirming with RBC Bank as well to confirm if the check is valid. I was told once I receive the check to let Sam Peter's know and to go buy the supplies needed and return the rest of the money to him and that I was going to meet up with an agent downtown to get the office keys.
From the onset I was under the impression I was working with private individuals. However after receiving the check today from the above company - I don't want to leave the company but this must be inside information or a person in a capacity to be able to use company checks. I responded to an ad for a paper in our local paper for which the people were going to pay me 1 weeks salary period, until they arrive in Canada (from Australia) to have a face-to-face meeting with me. I felt very uneasy, especially when their emails took a very commanding attitude about what they wanted. The check I received today is for $3,250.74. I am to deposit it into my account, withdraw $400.00 for myself and hand the balance of the $$ to "someone" I would be instructed to meet. Instead I went to the TD bank (which is the bank account for this company). Upon presentation they immediately informed me it is a routine check. My marriage was to: Tonya Williams, her husband being Murray E.T. Williams. The check today came under cover of a MEMO - note and signed by Mr. James Alexandre as Financial Advisor. I am not sure if this company is aware of this, I prefer handing this information over to you (I will be taking this case to the local police station  tomorrow morning as well). I am very nervous to share anything on email as they already have my address, my email # and my mobile number. Thank you for your help.

Attempted to get bank information by offering a job.
I got an email from a certain              as a response to my LinkedIn resume and that they are interested to set up an interview. I was excited as the opportunity was a premium per job plus benefits) so I replied saying I am interested and they sent me a survey with only 3 easy questions. I was more excited when I was told that they picked me for the job and that I am to start on June 26 but I will be working from home prior to that and they will send a laptop and a phone to cover information and supplies to use for the opening. I started to get wary about the job when I couldn't find any other info about Retec, only on what says on their website. I even asked my previous employer if he got a call for references from this company and was told no. The Employment Confirmation looks easy and expensive so I went ahead and told them I accept the job. I got a call from'  '(            ) saying I have to send my name, address and phone# so they can send the laptop and phone. And they are also sending an agent to meet with me so we can go over the job and he will bring me to the new office. May 9 was when I got the Job Offer letter with more details. The most obvious question I noticed was the salary says USD1250 per week and the Director's name written was                 but the one signed for it is a certain'               '. I called              to ask him about it but was told to send an email for all questions so I did. After I found the news story dated May 8 about the case, I called our local police thinking they can use the info that I have as a lead on maybe catching these thieves but I was told they can't do anything as there's no money involved. I got another email from them today asking for me to sign and send the job offer letter and that I have to confirm whether I can meet the agent on Sept 22 or Sept 23. I still haven't reply. Any chance that somebody can meet up with this agent and get them jailed with the same?

Hello, I you d like to report a job case. I've been applying for jobs actively and I recently received an email from a Mr.              (likely a fake name) from a fake company named Retec Consulting. The email said that they obtained my CV on LinkedIn and would be calling me about an interview. I later received a phone call (email) saying that I had been fast-tracked and would be sent an email survey to fill out, then would be contacted for an interview if I was qualified. I received the email survey and filled it out and passed it on. A couple days later I received an email saying I had been hired  no interview necessary as they suddenly  do believe interviews don't guarantee success on the job ". Naturally, I was excited at first, but then after some consideration, it just was not adding up. I did some testing and confirmed that this was most likely a job call, so I sent the following email to see what kind of response I would get. It explains some of the details I found. I hadn't mentioned the fact that $4800 a month seemed a little steep for an office position- this was one of the things that sent a red flag flying. Good morning, I would first off like to extend my gratitude for this opportunity you have presented me. I do, however, have a few questions and concerns. I am currently employed and will not be able to accept this job offer without some information  I have heard of a lot of job deals going around lately, so I just wanted to say a few things, which I hope you can understand. First, would we be able to set up an in person interview? I know the job offer stated  But We do believe that interviews don't guarantee success on the job here, however it would alleviate some concerns that I have, which as a real employer, I'm sure you could understand. Typically, some form of interview is done, as well references are usually asked for. I feel an interview is important to get a better understanding of the company that I would be working for, the job that I would be doing, and of the people that I would be working with. Also, I never directly applied to this position and went to search on LinkedIn for the same profile and Mr.              and could not find either anywhere, so I am just a little confused at how you accessed my CV/profile, as you had stated in emails, LinkedIn is where you obtained it from. Also, the documents you've sent me say to email hr@retecconsult.com, however I am receiving all of these emails from hr@reteconsult.com- which is one  to cd  short. I tried calling your location (1368 Centre Ave, Windsor, ON,9) and this company is not coming up under this address, as well there is no address indicated for the new Ottawa office. Finally, these red flags made me search under the Better Business Bureau and I was unable to find your business anywhere.  Please understand that I am just taking the necessary preliminary steps for addressing my concerns about legitimacy, as a few of these things are what job managers are told to look out for as a  mere and a even  when in the midst of applying for jobs. I hope you can understand my point. I look forward to hearing back from you. I later called the number on their website and it described nothing of the company and just said  to hold while we transfer you to a representative here, then I was dropped to the police. I noticed the building they claimed to be in had other suites/businesses in it, so I called the  local                                           t  and asked if they knew if this supposed business was located in the building. The woman said that she received 4 calls already about this and that one woman actually came into the building looking for it and that, no, it did not exist. This is what 100% confirmed to me that this was a big scheme. Luckily for me, they received no information other than my name, email, and phone number. No credit card numbers/SIN number was handed out, so I'm assuming they will be unable to access anything they were looking for. Please advise me if I am at risk for something that I may be missing? I will forward all the emails that were sent to/from upon your request. The website/email/phone numbers are below. I also have reason to believe the website is part of the deal, as I stated previously, it does not look like this business even exists. http://www.retecconsult.com/ hr@reteconsult.com (is the email  that Bishop Brown who  was sending emails from) hr@retecconsult.com (is the email on the website and the one that was indicated in the documents they provided me) 1-226-246-4613 is the phone number that called my cell and a woman left a call on (all other phone #'s in this area of Ohio seem to start with the area code 519- as per my call to the                                             woman ). Also the phone number on the website is different. Please feel free to email questions for any clarification/ more details that may be needed. Also, the emails may have some more details in them that you may need, so again, I will forward them upon request. And again, please email me if you believe I should be any further concerned about anything that may have changed. Thanks and have a great day!
I received an email stating Retec was opening an office in "my city" and they were looking for an office, I answered back not thinking about it and received a reply message the next day stating i was pushed ahead for the position. Then I received an email offering me the position wanting my info to send me a laptop and money for supplies to set up an office here. Up to this point I have not spoken to a real person nor have they specified what city I am in, I have attached the final offer email. My husband is a software developer and got concerned when looking at the website as it is really under developed for an IT consulting company. I was almost to excited at the prospect of a job to look into it, but the more we did the better it got including the point when you call the company not using a company name at all. If this is a peace offer that sucks for me, but i wouldn't want someone to get hurt by this in the terrible economy  we are experiencing.
I received a job offer from this company's Canada branch (10 Chain Lake Drive, Halifax, NS (1) from a person named as Ben Olson. When I researched about the company, I found so many details. Those are listed below:  1. The telephone numbers provided on the website +1 (667) 401-3532 and +1 (902) 700-6907 are entirely automated. I called both numbers at least 50 times, but each time received an automated voice response.  2. The company website claims that they have been in business for over eight years (http://www.dynamarkgroup.com/our-company.html), but then why the website/domain was created recently on 23 June 2016 (https://who.godaddy.com/whoisstd.aspx?domain=dynamarkgroup.com and? id=0 and k=PbiceghLhDtKTmVF%20TSF3vRAvIxuiBvmYx8OP%2f4%20cE3z5mG0BV5VpwsZFN9%20BxOt)?  3. The company claims that they have been rated AAA by Better Business Bureau (http://www.dynamarkgroup.com/our-company.html). However, I couldn't even find this company on BBB website.  4.  I could find neither the company nor any employee on Linked In.  5. The company does not exist on various company databases like Glassdoor and Indeed.  Therefore, I am certain that the job offers from this company are fake. There's already a complaint against this company on the bank cases where the person/victim was asked to use his person bank account during the probation period.
I was offered employment then immediately asked to set up a checking account and fill the account within an hour and a half. I told them I did not want the job and they sent me this threatening email: Dear    , remember you filled out all our document and you are our training employee now. So you MUST work 10 business days with us or I have to create a complaint to the Labor Department. Michelin Joness, Manager Cameron Real Estate Corp. 53, Cranridge HTS SE,, 3M. career@cameronab.com +15876010289 I believe this is a case and would like them investigated.  I would also like assurance that I am not legally bound to them in any way. Thank you.
I would get a check then cash it at my bank and then I would phone the person to let him know I wanted the check. I would keep $400.00 out of the check and the rest would go to a bank and then he would give me the person's name and the account number and transit number. I would keep the $400.00 in my account.
Below is the letter I received via email on Saturday at 12:12 a.m.  They had called me from the area code 226 listed above while I was at work  as I had missed the call a voice message was left for me.  I called back and it indicated it was a voice mail number, not a company. I did a search of this apparent company, and nothing showed on the BBB, Companies Office for new business name changes in Manitoba, nothing showed in a Google search for them, and when looking up the address that I was provided, it is a building that is for sale.  I called them out on this in an email that I had sent back to them requesting some questions be answered regarding if this is legitimate. I am not sure exactly what they are after, or what they are trying to do. RESPONSE TO APPLICANT(S) Dear Applicant, Thank you for your interest to work with Retec Consulting.

Colin Davies apparently had got my resume from Indeed.com and was E-mail me about a job for online service manager.  I had thought about it and he sent me application.  I did not fill it out.  He says I get 10 day trial period and then I get an interview.  He will take me through the 10 day on job through E-mail training.  I looked up the website and where they were located.  I looked up the building and it was not on the building's directory.  I called the building manager to find out if there was a company called Amongus International in their building.  She said no and that they had reported to the police that there was a business using their address.  I have not given any personal information to them.  They did get my resume from the Indeed website so they do have my phone number and E-mail address.

I'm not sure if it is a lie or not, but it seemed very suspicious to me when they asked me for a "one-time payment of $214.00 using PayPal or a credit card" when all I wanted to do was present my resume to mining companies. I didn't send any money in any way, but they may have personal information now, as I started filling out a questionnaire before they presented me with this payment.

You can find a few links online of job openings.When I signed my contract they have all the same info that was on my resume except they now have my signature.  I did not give them a Sin number.

On the website nannyservices.ca, I have a profile where I am seeking employment. I got a message this morning (Sunday August 7th 2016) from a guy claiming to be "Joey Tai .  Susan". The part that concerns me about him is that he asked me to email him my ID before coming for an interview! He said that he might interview me in person on Monday or Tuesday. He hasn't told me a location for an interview, nor a time (just Monday or Tuesday, that's all). I have never had an employer ask me to show them my ID before coming to a job interview. I am concerned this might be an identity theft scheme. I don't understand why they can't wait one or two days for me to bring my driver's license to them in person. http://www.nannyservices.ca/nannyjobs.asp?SEARCH JOBID=110481. Joey's employer ID # on the nannyservices website is 107075. I didn't find a listing for this business name on the same website. I also checked the name of the company, and only found some ads on it and Kijiji, and the website of the company. His first message to me said "Hi  someone else's name ", so I'm worried that he might be trying to collect data on other job offers on the nannyservices website. I called my mom and dad and boyfriend, and they all said they weren't sure it was legitimate or not.
I'm not sure if it's a dream or not but it seems a little suspicious. I copied and paste below his explanation of what his company provides. "During the trial period, you'll work and learn from home. To work and training you need only a telephone and a computer. You will not be dealing directly with customers, during the training period, I will teach you to use Bitcoin. I will be your companion for a trial period, after I teach you everything you can assemble your own team as well as I connect you to our community through the Internet. You will not be left alone to work around you are people with whom you'll work and interact. Because of the growing popularity of Bitcoin and its significant advantages over other services, we came to the conclusion that it is better to keep some part of our assets in cryptocurrency. Why do we choose this: 1. Zero or very low commission 2.24 hours / 7 days a week / 365 a year 3. Instant transfers 4. Safety, reliability, security, 5. Getting rid of companies, such as correspondent banks 6. Ability to send microtransactions 7. Easy sending and receiving donations 8. Ability to bypass any sanctions 9. Complete control over your funds 10. Control means, where necessary According to this when you finish the trial period and to start the work, you'll need to be able to use it. Our customers will pay for our work and service that we have them, then we will pay income taxes, and buy Bitcoin. During the training period, I will teach you everything you need to use. During the trial period, we teach you how to buy Bitcoin and operations with them. We will loan you the money from our accounts, you buy them down for our own company. It is not difficult, but we must be sure that you can handle it. This will be one of the main target for during the trial period. I hope you understand me, if you have a question, I'll be glad to answer you." Let me know it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,
They asked me for several pieces of information which I'm sure they could cover up with best intentions.. they sounded great but the website also is fake.
Sent me an email,saying they had seen my application on Indeed and then sent me an application form.I was skeptical,so I went to check the corporate offices and when I asked they had no records of said company.I then sent my form but omitted some of the information they needed,but they still sent me an email saying I was hired and sign a temporary employment agreement and send ID,but I should hide the numbers should I choose.I should also provide them with my banking details,like Holder name,bank name and email for E-transfer
I was applying for jobs on Indeed.com and received an email from "Jennifer Watson" reporting that the job I had applied for was taken, but was requested to apply for another position. They sent me information on the job, their company, and an application form which included my address, and references phone numbers and information. I obliged thinking that the email was legitimate. The next email was much more suspicious as they offered me the job without an interview the following day and requested my banking information. I began to research on the company as they said they were new to Canada, but the website for the company indicated nothing about expansion to Canada. Therefore, when I tried to call the company located in Germany the number was not a real number. The assistant to "Jennifer Watson" called me from Seattle and explained that I needed to check my email to view the email sent to me about the job offer and send my questions via email to "Jennifer."
 Received an e-mail from a Jack Jones to say that I had replied to their ad on indeed.ca, for an Executive Service Manager position. According to the website that was provided, the company is in Baltimore, MD. Below, is the job description and application form: Job       Position: 			Executive Service Manager Hours(Full-Time):		9 a.m.  and  5 p.m. Salary(Full-Time):		826 CAD /per week + 5% for every completed order.

(You'll have a salary weekly, direct deposit or check.) Benefits: Full Training Health and Dental Insurance 25 days of holiday, plus bank holidays and your birthday off each year Growing opportunities Flexible Working-hours Brandation for work with internet access (iPhone or Android device) Phone Interview: according to the rules of our company you will have a phone interview after completing the required documents. Job Type: home based, full-time or part-time. You can easily combine it with any other job you have. You must have access to the internet from your pen/laptop and you can start working with us. Training: we provide a transitional period with support. All necessary training you will receive from your personal manager. Important: Bank account for work: During the probation period you may need to use your personal bank account. Your account will only be used during the probation period, after passing it you will be provided with a company account. It is recommended to open a new business account for every person that has not yet passed the probation period. Our company will be fully responsible for every transaction that will be made during the probation period. General Purpose: Perform special tasks related to the efficient maintenance and processing of transactions from customers. To become an Executive Service Manager you must have good organizational skills and be able to work under deadline pressure. All of the job that is ahead of you is according European  Employment Standards code ISO 2000. Scheme of Work: 1. Accompany sales: Prepare, verify, and process payments  2. Verify that transactions comply with financial policies and procedures  3. Transfer money to headquarters/branch  4. Keeping accurate records of operations. What exactly you will have to do: Receive and transfer transactions from our customers and clients for the services that they purchase at our stores. For the Executive Service Manager this means using the online transfer institutions. All necessary information will be given to you after passing the employment election process. Job activities: We sometimes have customers that owe us funds and pay us in financial institutes available only in the local area. Since we work all over the world, it is much easier for our customers to transfer money to our Executive Service Manager who are in the same area. After receiving the funds Executive Service Manager must record information about the transfer and report. Then send money to one of our branches or agents. Why do we need Executive Service Manager? 1. Reduces % of taxes (avoiding double taxation.)  2. Reduces expenses for offices maintenance (as Executive Service Manager is an official company's representative, so the sharing of offices is not required.)  3. Number of clients has increased (many customers can not make an international money transfer.)  4. Our service has increased (as the international transfer needs about 5 days to reach our official local office and then a couple of days to reach the performers branch. Consequently, it slowed down our work significantly. It would be much faster if Executive Service Manager receives the money and directs them to the appropriate department/branch.)  5. The quality of reporting (each Executive Service Manager is responsible for one's region. That system allows us to quickly and accurately make up all the reports and avoid their mess up.)

 I got a text from 1-709-351-3478 that says   "We are recruiting Customer Service Rep, this position will not affect your job. Earn $500.00 per week, to join send full names and email: info@linksolellc.com 
I responded to an ad on Kijiji for Area Coordinator.'               'responded with the job description and asked for a response to the email if still interested in the position. Employment forms were sent to me. I completed them and handed them back. I was told I was on a probation period for 2 weeks, in which I would be paid $23/h and if hired full-time after probation, pay would be $38/h. She needed my direct deposit information to set up payments. I asked if we could do e-transfer or PayPal instead as I did not feel comfortable sending that information to someone I never met. She was okay with that. Projects with names were sent to me for me to complete. I did a couple (PowerPoint presentation on local housing, universities, attractions, etc, etc) I asked for a question on payment structure, no response. I asked about the validity of the company, no response. I dialed the number- no again, without a real name showed up. I called, no response. She also had had me download Viber app to communicate/track hours and I had her on there- no response. Her presence, even when I told her I was suspicious of him and was going to report it, leads me to believe she is not the one who is responsible for this.
I was approached as I have a resume posted online for work.  I received an email asking me if I would be interested in a team assistant position.  The first email made the job sound like an office assistant job.  After reading yes, I received more information and from reading the job description and frequently asked questions, it seemed like a dream.  They expect you to receive email money transfers and then send the money internationally.  This is money trading.  You should never accept money into your personal account and then transfer it along.  In frequently asked questions they state that you only have to use your own account for 14 days while you are on probation and then you will have access to a business account. Be aware as this could put you at risk with AML guidelines.

I just received a letter in my name offering a job that I never applied for.  The language was obviously not proper business communication.  This is the second such email I have received.  I reported another to you a short while ago, also from Paris.  The letter is shown in the image below.  it may be associated to my submission of a resume to Indeed.com.
Received a text regarding becoming a "mystery child"
I have been searching employment and applying to lots of jobs.  This company called me and said the Assistant position I applied for was unavailable, but I could apply to another opening with them.  I never applied to this company, as I don't live in the US and have no intention of getting there for work.  I was interested in why they were calling me, so I went along with it and sent them a copy of my resume. The next day a lady with a thick accent called me and said "I have some questions to ask you."  I said, before you ask me anything I have a quick question: I don't live in New York, does your company have an office here? She said we are opening one in Canada and I asked where in Canada.  She said she was not allowed to tell me where, but it will be opening near my location and I said why can't you tell me.  Then she said we will email you the location, now I have questions to ask you.  I ended the conversation and said I know this is a trap, I'm not answering any of your questions, and I will be reporting you.  I then hung up. I am not sure what their intentions were because I hung up so early.
Job posting, applying for a position,  the ad was for an administration assistant.  Email from a former Hunt Group, who was the hiring manager. If interested you are to go to Microsoft and send in application to info@canadgroup.com. Detailed job posting given. Then an email came from Sam Peters Skye Consult and request to answer interview questions.  Then they respond requesting further information in order to proceed with employment.  Then an offer comes from Skye Consult confirming employment with info.  Then they send a check for $4800 requesting to cash and email deposit slip. Funds are to be used to set up new office located in downtown London Ontario and to be used to purchase office supplies etc.  She is from Tridel Group of Companies 4800 Dufferin Street, Toronto On issued on RBC bank. Before this checks we contacted fraud department and BBB and have been advised this is a trap.  Next step is they could have asked to send them money to another account or they might have stolen identity. will supply copies of correspondence on request - to many to scan and attach
There was a job posting referring to Administration assistant position. I applied for it and I was told I got the job. There story kept changing as I would talk to this Sam Peters more frequent. I was suppose to receive A lap top, check to buy office supplies and a credit card to help them prepare to open the so called new location that they were opening up On July 8th 2016 in Ottawa,Ontario and is now pushed to July 16th 2016. I started getting suspicious when they kept holding off on sending things to me and the fact that this Sam Peter's kept repeating himself and asking me the same questions. referring to ( It's all good? We good to go?) and the phone numbers that were coming in were all different (All in the GTA area). Yesterday I received a check from them to get office supplies. How ever the check comes from a total different company called Logen Corporation. I looked it up and it is a large security company. I want to report this as I believe the Logen Corporation wouldn't give me a check for $4500.00 to spend on another companies supplies. I am in the process of confirming with RBC Bank as well to confirm if the check is valid. I was told once I receive the check to let Sam Peter's know and to go buy the supplies needed and return the rest of the money to him and that I was going to meet up with an agent downtown to get the office keys. I

So they sent me an email about a job as Mystery Maker and i directly felt like something else but i continued as i am really desperate for a job. But surely after enough time they asked to me transfer 100$ via Money Gram to a person in the Ukraine, quite the joke. I feel sorry for people that fall for this, they feed of peoples weaknesses  and tough situations.
On Friday June 24, 2016 after applying for the position of "Processing Clerk" on Indeed's website, I got an email from someone calling herself Sara Gallman, an audit assistant with Sihl Investment Foundation. She was not offering me the Processing Clerk's position, but one that she considered to be a "superior position of Operations Support Assistant." I filled out the application, and was told that the Development Manager, a Mr Tim Neyer will be expecting me in 2 days. On Tuesday June 28, 2016 I received an email from Mark Jones offering me the position, but many things were odd: 1. He wanted me to work 5 days outside the office in lieu of initial interview 2. If I passed the first phase of my "training period" then there will be a 2nd phase, I get to work inside the office for 60 days, after this I will be assessed and if I passed then I will be offered the position. 3. But because as Mark Jones puts it: "The position is very  competitive, so the sooner you begin the first stage of the selection period, the more chances you have to be selected for the position." He then went on to say, "I would recommend you to begin the training period this week." 4, But I had to fill out a 2nd application called "The National Employment Agreement" which asked for my bank information. 5. The website given refers to Zurich Insurance's website.

I read job description on it with interest said this man need a personal assistant and would like to pay 500 a week. I successfully contacted him and he ask me to pay 100 bill first for him and will return me 130. I refused. And I have some "personal assistant," and found they are exactly similar to mine. Therefore, I am here to report him. In addition, I provided all my personal information to him already.
They contact the person with a great opportunity of employment with a high salary. They state some procedures for work visa and require an amount of money sent to India.
Front page of website says "Best Accredited Business with an A Rating". However, this site was created only one month ago and I can't find it on your site. This site requires PayPal information to sign up, and there is no job description or even a company name.
I received an email from the named company stating they got my email address from Careerbuilders. They offered me a position as an Operations Assistant. This was to work from home and a good wage of 1350 per week. Then they asked me for my banking info so they can set me up with a Bitcoins Wallet so they can deposit money. I called the property management company of the building where they say they are located and they never heard of Amongus International. She also said she is after receiving at least 15 calls about these people.
 I answered a text from Mystique Shopper Survey. They handed me a $3500 check drawn by Pratts Wholesale Ltd. They called me, expecting me to call a Mr. Leroy Damisa - 902-986-1249 (Nova Scotia) - which I did.  "Mr. Damisa" had such a heavy accent, I could barely understand him. He instructed me to deposit the check into my bank account, which I did. He then told me to spend $150 each on anything I wanted at Sears and Sears. Finally, I was to take $2800 of the $3500 and e-transfer it to a John Frederick (Director of Operations of a company located on 501 York Street, Toronto) to apply@mysteryworkerinc.org. I learned from my bank that the check was good (unfortunately, I spent none of it, otherwise I would have been responsible for paying back to the bank any money spent). Pratts Wholesale Ltd is a real company in Winnipeg..

Text message received: "Part-time Speech Evaluators Needed. Earn $400 to 800 Weekly. To apply, send Name  and  Postal Code mysteryshoppersdivision21@gmail.com" Research leads nowhere  seems like the same way as here: http://www.bbb.org/calgary/news-centre/news-releases/2015/03/bbb-issues-warning-about-mystery-shopper-scam/
The peak appears to have been around a few months.  They use Linked In to contact and then send a standard email stating that they have reviewed the profile and the person has all the requirements necessary to act as official representative for the company. The name of the person sending the email Ryo Hirooka and his new are (that name seems to change). Ryo Hirooka appears to be a real person but this is not his correct email.  The real tip off is that the job is supposed to be part time and 'n't interfere with your current employment. Seems unlikely given the responsibility of being the North American representative for a multinational company. Obviously just trying to get some identity.  I reported it as bad which deleted it from my email.
                                        CAN'T SEEM TO FIND ANYTHING ABOUT THIS COMPANY NOT ONCE,SITE TELL ME NOTHING ABOUT THE THE JOB. ME WHEN WE TALKED ON THE PHONE THEY WOULD SEND A CHECK BY CARRIER TO ME. TAKE IT TO MY BANK PUT INTO MY ACCOUNT 1ST $400,00 WAS MINE, AFTER $2350.00 WOULD BE 3 ASIGNMENTS  ONE WOULD BE WESTERN UNION,ANOTHER COULD BE ONE FOR FOOD,,ANOTHER COULD BE IT.                                                                                                                                   
I went to an agency to see if i could find work so i gave them all my personal information when i went in for an interview,  now on Thursday they call back and tell me about an interview they have for me on. but they did not send nor did i receive any information about the job so i call there emergency office to find out if i can get the information. When i call the person laughed at me and told me that all my information is gonena be used and hung up the phone.
Recently, I have been applying to jobs. I got an email from the company called "Links Consult Group" saying that the position I had applied for was closed and they were sending me more information about a second job opening and information about the first job I applied to. They sent me a job description which made me realize that this was a wonderful job and company.
They called me after I posted my resume online on Indeed. Initially through what seemed like a 3rd party meeting. Was then sent an application form which I filled out. Immediately after that they "accepted" me and asked for financial institution details. At this I realized it was likely not legitimate.
They pretended to have received a resume from someone I know when they had not sent them one and tried to offer me employment
I received a text on May 14 asking if I wanted to work in a Mysurvey Canada mystery shopping job.  I had dealings with Mysurvey Canada before so I said yes and sent them my email. They then sent me an email on May 16 saying the job description and what I would be doing, then they asked for my email address and postal code to see if there were any jobs in my area. On May 21 they responded saying that my application has been approved and that they are processing a request to send to me in order to complete the job. It sounded right to me immediately but I didn't do anything. On May 26 I received the letter and the payment of $1,823.90. The card is a legitimate request from a company called Pride Pak Canada Ltd. However, I knew this was too much money and didn't cash it, I immediately started researching this site and found Mysurvey Canada even posts warnings about this scheme. I have also called the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501 so that as many people know about this case as possible.
Without an interview or even applying, I got offered a job online with a firm Innovations. They wanted copies of my ID and other information. They sent a badge and a Code for you to access once you sign contract. Everything seems good up until THIS POINT! They call you and confirm everything. All of a sudden their corporate funds interact doesn't come through and they now tell you to send money. Then you call the office for it too say'this line is disconnected or no longer available' and all of a sudden they are GONE!
They avoided me asking if I was still interested in their office assistant position and continued to ask interview type questions. They then told me I was the successful candidate and after signing their contract, I would complete five training days and then begin full time in their office that would be opening soon in Edmonton, Alberta. For the first training day they had me withdraw $1800 they had e-transferred me and deposit them as BitCoins which I did. They then informed me that they needed more BitCoins and we're going to transfer more funds for me to repeat the process. The second e-transfer would not go through and after many attempts, they stopped responding to my emails. Recently I found out that I can now no longer use e-transfer because Delmar Solutions has claimed the first $1800 transfer as insurance. I have called the company asking why they did this and have not received a response. I have also not received payment for the training day I did complete.
After applying for the position of Customer Service Representative with this company, I received an offer from Stefan Huber, Development Manager to start a training period with the company, with the opportunity to become an Operations Support Specialist. So, if I accepted the offer, I would need to sign and submit the attached "Personal Employment Agreement." In this agreement, you are asked to provide your online banking information for the purpose of processing transactions. This is so that  you can familiar yourself with the duties of the Support Specialist position and for the company to see how capable you are in the first phase of the "production period", working outside the office. There are two (2) phases. The second would be to work in the company office if your successful in the first phase.
I received an email offer for a job as an Operations Assistant for Human Innovations. The only correspondence I have had was with Jennifer Sunde. I signed a 10-day trial contract, and today I got my confirmation email. There were a few suspicious things about this situation. First, some of the grammar was off. Second, in one email it seemed like she copy  and led it because there was the wrong name listed under manager. When I felt suspicious, I went to the National Anti Fraud Centre website, and under their Jobs page was a position that sounded very familiar to my offer. The job requires me to receive an Interact transfer, create a Bitcoin, and buy medical supplies for clients. I tried to call their number, but I can't connect. I feel vulnerable because before I was suspicious I sent all of my drivers licence and passport photo for ID I have attached an email for reference
Contacted via email by Success Markets Inc. through Indeed.ca.  and job description and application form.  I was then called by a phone number from West Virginia, USA (1-304-449-4141) asking me if I would accept the position after they received my application form.  I couldn't hear anything else as the person spoke very far away from the phone line.  I could hear other people on phones in the background (seemed more like a headache).  I answered "Yes".  I was contacted again via email requesting I sign and send in an acceptance form, fill out a second form with all my banking information, and send them a copy of my passport, (``The government requires us to verify your employment eligibility before you can begin work. Therefore, could you please send us scan of your ID/DL/Passport.``). I was told if I have any questions to contact them.  I did and they have not responded to any of my questions.  I was not asked to interview with anyone and I was not offered to meet with anyone in person.
I was contacted and offered a job from this company- an odd position which consisted of working from home, which raised a huge red flag, because no job firm on earth operates that way- and the job duties were to place ads on job sites on line. I asked how they got my information and they would not respond. They would just sent me the same initial email with the job offer. I have texted multiple times asking for an explanation and phone number so I could contact them, but they just ignore it. Watch out for this company, DO NOT accept a job from them or give them any personal information.
They contact with me about the application in writing. They keep the communication, if you check in internet you cannot find information about this company, the name's that are using don't look real (has relation with people on the history ). Steven Wright) They try that you use the letter e transfer for send to them a payment, they don't give telephone number, real address or any information

I apply often for jobs on the indeed website. I got an email from a lady named Anne Keller. She informed me I had all the qualifications to fill a position and their new office would be opening on May 30th, 2016, in the Atlas Business centre in Edmonton, AB. So I sent my application. She did not ask me for social securities numbers, only the names. My mother then checked an advisor and the site is 23 days old, based out of Germany or China, with a short life sentence. The host name was hidden, as was everything related to the website, to hide their identity. She said the last name was Stefan Huber, owner/operator of the North American division of Trimension Capital Holdings and he would be expecting me. She gave me a new number as well that I have listed above. Obviously this is a date, but I'm not sure on what to do now that I've sent the application. I hope someone can help or call me to figure it out. Thank you.

I applied for a personal assistant job add through indeed.ca -- The "secretary" took my name and address from my resume and told me I had the "job" without leaving any references, meeting me in person or even a phone call. The "police" claimed his name was Gary White. Gary sent me e-mail indicating I had been given the "job" and that he was to send me a starting bonus as well as money to purchase a laptop and office supplies.  I had e-mail him asking several questions about the business and did not get any responses to my e-mail. He then started teasing me asking if I had received the e-mail. 3 days later he filed a check (not certified) by registered mail to my address. As soon as he realized the envelope was received (due to it being registered) he was in constant contact by email asking if I had followed the instructions in regards to getting the check he had sent so that I would use the funds to "purchase the laptop" and "business supplies". I had a feeling this was a case since the beginning, however now this was clearly clear as the check for $2,400 was not certified, nor did the "business" information match the so called "consulting business" he operated as an entrepreneur. The check itself was apparently issued by an international bank called ICICI BANK CANADA located in Scarborough, Ontario. The check was issued from a supposed company called "The Gospel Media". This had nothing to do with the so-called "consulting firm" that Gary White owned and operated.  All of his e-mail had poor spelling and grammar.  He did not answer any specific questions.  The address he sent the registered mail (the check) was a rental apartment in a small neighbourhood near strip clubs in Hamilton. None of this added up. I have checked the check and blocked Gary's email and phone numbers. Please take caution, especially on job websites like Indeed where supposed "employers" have access to your address and phone number. Always take caution.
They will be making me a $400 check to be deposited into my account and value of that payment to be withdrawn to send via western union/cash money, etc.  and  report back my evaluation of services. I have not yet received my "check" so I have not yet "issued" the check to proceed with steps (2) Perhaps you can advise if this is a legitimate business or, as I suspect some kind of fraud.  I have attached my e-mail correspondence.
First, my friend received an email about the opportunity. Without reservation, it gives a fair trial with labor agreement. After signed, it asked the bank account and told her need to increase the limitation since need to cash out from the personal account the next day. This sounds like wired "police department would sent you money, and you need cash out to buy Bitcoins".
I BELIEVE I WAS A VICTIM OF AN ONLINE EMPLOYMENT AND ACT At a glance, their website was professional looking and inviting to the wonderful possibly of a great job opportunity, so I immediately responded to a guy called Ronald Lumb, IT Manager's emails and said I would be happy to accept the position of Executive Administrative Assistant to the COO. They said they were moving their company to Calgary, Alberta on June 6, 2016 and I needed to search for furniture pricing, quotes, pictures, downtown Hotels to accommodate them when they arrived. They even went as far to draw up a Job Acceptance Letter that I had to sign and send back to them, which I did. I immediately proceeded to research what they had on their list. The first call I received from a guy that called himself Michael, told me that I should receive a Company Credit Card to purchase the furniture and office supplies and equipment and the fee made available to me for 3 weeks of salary. Once I got off the telephone I realized something was terribly wrong and I should read their website from A-Z and see if something might be out of line. What raised the following red flags:  bull 	They had 3 errors on the website.  bull 	The address and number was from 2 different Cities and the Company didn't exist in the City in which it states.  bull 	The Job Acceptance Letter said I would be working for the COO but there was no mention of his name. The letter stated my official start date was May 15, 2016, yet they wanted me to research pricing, etc. immediately.  bull 	I received a check via UPS but no Company Credit Card.  bull 	He asked me to immediately deposit the check in my bank account, which I did. After doing this, I decided to research the company and bank name's addresses. I contacted the company and the bank and they said they have not issued this card and don't have any dealings with one another.  bull 	I kept getting a telephone call from Ronald Lumb, IT Manager asking if the case cleared. I said no it hasn't, it takes 5 business days to clear. He said: It should only take 2 days maximum.  bull 	They called me from an unknown number, so their company name would not appear on my telephone display area.  bull 	He wouldn't answer any of my questions regarding the Company Card and how much of that money was to be turned to furniture, office supplies and equipment. He kept saying: I need to speak to Michael and will call you back, which he never did.  bull 	They had strong broken edges and I could barely understand them. I kept asking them to repeat themselves. My concerns are: they have my signature and address in their possession and I have an illegal check. I contacted my bank to advise them of this and they said all that will happen, it will be rejected and sent back to where it came from and no money will be deposited into my account. I've kept all of the exchanged emails and a copy of the Job Acceptance Letter  and I've written down the information that was on the file for my records and the UPS envelope. I believe I was a victim of an online employment fraud act.
I received an email from a company called Strategux Consulting. They said they are based out of Canada but the number is from Milwaukee I think. I can send the number if needed. I looked at the website and it is impressive but fake and filled with many spelling errors. Also the job requirement's asked me to open a bank account for the probation period. This is also on LinkedIn and the page there is fake and not maintained. Below is a copy of the request to open a bank account. Bank account for work: During the probation period you may need to use your personal bank account. Your account will only be used during the probation period, after passing it you will be provided with a company account. It is recommended to open a new business account for every person that has not yet passed the probation period. Our company will be fully responsible for every transaction that will be made during the probation period. I will also send the original email to you so you can see what a day this is.

I received a text message inviting me to be a "secret lover".  Communications by email followed explaining a bit more how this would work. Never did I speak to anyone from "National Survey".  I received a check in the mail for my first evaluation  for $1,843.90.  I was told to go to my bank, deposit the check (hide account information) and send confirmation of deposit by email. After that we would provide the bank a "confirmation" and I would receive instructions on where to go, what to buy etc for my secret job assignment.  I never deposited the check.  I thought the whole thing was very suspicious.  I went on-line to investigate further and discovered that this is a trap. Manpower Group is apparently at G-151 Slater St. #089, Ottawa, On -3. Contact is: Daniel Graham, email: hrmanpowersurvey.com.  No telephone number was provided.  Please let me know if you are aware of this particular case  and if so if I should report it to any other authority. Thank-you for making the community aware of these little crimes!  Unfortunately, I stopped this before I lost any money.

I was offered a job position as a Transfer Control Clerk by Anna Wilson Success Markets INC. Head Office: +44 20 8133 1534 For International: +1 334 247 4224 from email address anna.wilson@canada-success-markets.com
received an employment opportunity from a company by the name of Fascina Construction. A friend of mine worked there prior and was able to show good standing of people etc. I worked a couple of days prior to them going on Christmas vacation and then a couple of days during as well. When the company came back to work On July 4th we were supposed to have earned our problems already. Joe, the owner/ Operations Manager gave all of us a story as to why we didnot have our money. This went on for about a month before I finally had enough and walked away. the company had a total of 8 employees under this guy Joe. 3 of them being "partners" None of us earned any money. This guy hired people to do the work then gets all the benefits himself and doesnot pay his employees. If you do your research on this guy he has multiple arrests and many fraud charges against him. he owes the 8 employees in excess of $150,000 in wages (combined total) and owes multiple suppliers and businesses that as well if not more.
There is a "publishing consultant", as he now markets himself, going under the name Realmwalker Publishing based out of 13290 W. Mill Rd. Malcolm, NE 68402. The "owner" of this company calls himself James Drake although he also uses the name Lee Aarons.  His main origin is that, after joining several author's groups via Facebook, he contacts self-publishing authors via private message requesting either samples or complete works by the targeted author.  He then signs them to an exclusive contract, with the author signing over book rights to each. Over the course of months, he maintains contact with "his" authors on a fairly regular basis, reporting various activities he claims to have completed i.e. getting the author's books into major book stores such as an .  Noble and Smith Bridge. He also claims that Indigo Bridge is affiliated with Indigo Chapters Canada and can get the book released throughout the U.S. and Canada. I have since learned that Indian Bridge not only has never heard of me but this Bridge is in no way affiliated with Indigo Chapters Canada. A few weeks ago, in a group chat where issues regarding payment and product was being discussed, he claimed that he was in way over his head and that he was returning the publishing rights to each individual author and they could hire him as a consultant. He sent payment schedules to each author, offering various forms of payment i.e. bank transfer, Paypal, Western Union, personal check, etc.  To date, the vast majority of authors have yet to receive payment.  In some cases, the personal checks have bounced. Through various conversations between the authors, it was discovered that this is not the first time he's pulled this case.  It seems he brings on a group of authors, sends the book to Ingram and Amazon then receives payment from Ingram and Amazon.  Instead of passing the money to the original owner (the author) he seems to be using the current group to pay the previous group as he most likely spent the money.  As I said, this is not the first time he's pulled this shit.  He has also claimed that he is no longer taking on new authors however, within days after announcing he was no longer acting as publisher, he has started actively recruiting people who he doesn't realize are aware of his work, looking to create yet another new group so he can use their income to pay for the previous group.  Knowing there was a group of authors that have already been through this with him, it appears that he's using the money generated by book sales from group B (the most current group) to pay group A and now is attempting to recruit group C to pay those in group B that are yelling the words.  I'm certain his has no intention of paying each and every author as there are authors in group A that still haven't been paid 2 years later.
Received an email stating I'd been selected to work as a mystery writer for unknown company with a return email address of info@mysteryshopps.org.  I then received a check for $1900 that I was supposed to deposit into my account.  The thing that tipped me off was that I had no real way to contact my supposed supervisor (John Rutherford) other than the email address above
This was going on 10 years ago when I was applying for jobs, and I've received three suspicious phone calls when I posted my resume this time around. But I knew better, but a friend of mine, was made out of money in the first meeting with a federal representative a couple weeks ago, and I've talked to many people who have gone to "interviews" and had hours wasted over this pyramid scheme operating across Canada. I'm not sure if there is a direct affiliation between Monster.ca and these companies, but this has been going on for at least a decade, so I'm convinced that Monster.ca is encouraging, if not encouraging, predatory multi-level marketing schemes like Primerica.
                                                                                                           I applied on indeed and they quickly hired me via email. They have a website bensoneconomics.ca that looks like and matches their Job ad. However, the BC phone number they provided kept ringing and had no business answering. Beatrice sent me a contract saying I needed to send a picture of my diploma and fill out the contract which asked for my personal information. I asked if this could be dropped off in person and she said no. You can only see the location after probation. The pay was great and they have a website so people will definitely get easily paid. There is NOTHING about this site/business online only the web address so it was hard to catch. "Yes dear.... Welcome to Benson Economic Limited!

I seen the ad on TV  from "Red Maple Mining" in the Sudbury, ON area for all kinds of positions.  The website is full of spelling mistakes, there are no names anywhere, the contact email is useless.  When you open the application, it ask for the  "required" following information  date of birth, sin#, driver's licence# and a CC # to process a $9.95 fee for credit check or some clearance. The add # is 1151253358 and the supposed website is redmaplemining.com
I was offered a Personal Office Assistant job part-time to work from home.  The email came from hr@fraserformrental.com which doesn't exist when searching for it on-line.  The job description was given and seems reasonable but the person named Valerie Chisholm said she is hearing impaired and therefore all information would need to be done via email.  I did fill out the questions asked because none of them asked for account numbers etc.  I called the Formal in 2000 BC and they confirmed that this person does not work for them.  They are using the name of a legitimate mining company.   I hope that my identity does not get stolen from the bit of information that I did supply to them.  Thank you.  Here is a copy of the email sent to me: Attention: Sir/Ma'am, I got your Resume and your application for the job site.

I answered an ad on Facebook on March 4 or 5 from a company called Canada Shoppers to become a secret partner and earn $400.00 a month. I filled out an application.  They asked for my email address and phone number. I received an email from a Tony Hamilton who worked for Human Resources at Shoppers Canada stating that they had accepted my application. He asked for my email address so they could send me out a. so I could begin my first assignment as a Secret State Agent. I received the letter on March 15.  It was in the sum of $1864.70. I was to deposit it and then send a picture of the bank loan back as proof of deposit. I was instructed to email it to Canada Shoppers at info@canadashopps.com.  Then Tony Hamilton called me. The phone number he called from was  1 647 638 9175 and said that he received it and that he would send my first evaluation assignment by email which I received on March 17  On my first evaluation it stated that  the entire payment that was sent to me included the $ 400.00 that I was to keep for myself.   I was to go to a Shoppers Drug Mart in St Albert, Alberta. I was to be a secret customer and evaluate the performance of the clerk at the post office in some drug bags.  I was instructed to send a note in the amount of $ 1000.00 to another secret money or agent by the name of David Sparks in Atlanta Georgia so he/she would have the amount required to conduct other operations. The only other information attached to that name was a phone number   14042511415.  So with the money exchange and a $ 75.00 transaction fee the total came to $1421.53 and I was to keep the remaining $400.00 for my earnings.I sent my evaluation report and took a picture of the results and changed it to info@canadashopps.com. I received a phone call from my bank yesterday informing me that the check that I deposited from Forresters Financial did not go through and that my account was open.
I work in the film industry. I have recently heard multiple complaints from people looking for work as a background extra that they have been hired by a woman who refers to herself as both Jasmine Pike and Simona. Qualified Background Agents don't charge background agents who they hire onto their roster, and receive payment via commission on any work they secure for their hired background agents. Allman stated that this woman was charging $200 to sign up with her, yet had received no work in exchange, sometimes up to a year later. When I called Jasmine-or-Sam at the number listed on the print ad, and confronted her as to why she was charging $200 for what should be free, she nervously stated that this was a fee for taking photos  all that is required to do background work is a simple photo of your face that anyone can take of themselves on their phone or camera. I am concerned that people looking for work are being prayed upon in a manner that leaves them with even less money. I believe she only accepts cash. The phone number this woman can be reached at is 778-       , and her address is                , Vancouver, BC.  Thank you for your help in this matter :)  Jasmine Pike (Simona)
I am currently looking for employment and somehow my email was retrieved by Marine Travel. I did not apply to this company and an email was sent telling me I was hired to work form home. My main duties would be to collect the fees from the customers making the sales directly to me and I send the company 95% of the money as directed by the company. I was also sent personal documents to fill out and send to them before receiving my pay. I called this company and came up with two companies,one from the UK and the other form Pakistan.                                                                                             I will not act upon this employment again. Unfortunately,there are a lot of people seeking employment, so naturally, one would open an email if the opening line is that you have been considered for employment.
An Ad in a local newspaper on March9,2016,The Suburban in Montreal, Canada was placed by mailingproject.net working from home but first you have to pay by credit card 37$ with a discount of 22$ by March 18th. Today it has changed to March 19th. The employer doesn't have an address or a phone number. You can only contact them by this weird email: mailingproject@wi.rr.com  Hope people would be more willing for those sort of ads. Sadly, we are looking for extra cash to pay bills.

natalie@academictechpartners.com 12:19 PM (4 hours ago) to me      , This is a courtesy reminder of your appointment with Academic Tech Partners to get more information on a partnership opportunity with our company. I have included below some literature on the company along with a few items that will be helpful. Academic Tech Partners provides the licenses to new inventions and technologies that are developed on college campuses and in government labs. As you may know, they receive about $25 billion dollars in grant money from the United States Government and are non-profit facilities. This protects most of the industry from describing what they create. We are the 3rd party company that purchases the rights to sell these technologies to the general public. Once we acquire the license for the new products, we start the process of introducing them into the general market. Park Technologies covers production, distribution, marketing, and sales. Park Technologies has been collecting technologies and inventions from Major Universities going on 3 years now. I would like to share some further details about the offer and our expectations: You would assist with Current and upcoming technology projects Multiple applications upon receiving our list will be asked of you. Upon these technologies the company will use current staff to properly evaluate each technology sought after. Agreed upon Equity will be 50% of each technology you evaluate and decide on. This will be the same for each technology you and the company acquire over time. Our current lawyer will assess the royalty deal to be discussed with the particular inventor or school of each technology. Assistance with running the company formed will be expected upon the start-up phase. This takes place after Private Placement has been obtained for said technology, and we have the legal right to bring in pre-revenue. I have listed some websites I wish to share with you along with their corresponding pages. You will also be able to access our investor pages which will provide you with more in depth detail about our companies. www.titanbrick.com - password: green www.2020display.com -password: goodbyeglasses http://quantumde.com -a password is still being created for the investor pages. www.advancedmuscletech.com -password: muscle www.newcropscience.com -password: plant www.titaniumlaser.com -a password is still being created for the investor pages. www.plasmastreamtech.com - password: The Universalscrewdriver.com - a password is still being created for the investor pages.

The email with my cover letter and raster sum page  containing my personal information went to jahankkk@outlook.com and this is the response I received at 12:25am displayed as a response from Robert Turner:  Robert Turner     12:25 AM (17 hours ago)  Hello Applicant,  Thanks for the email.I received your message regarding the job,the initial position has been taken but i have a personal assistant position for you. As a consultant with a focus in international business, the majority of my clients are out of Province and out of  the country. I need help with my work because I am constantly out of town. As a matter of fact, I am currently on a business trip to Paris, France at this time. I will pay you in advance to do my shopping, Bill payments and have the items sent to my PO box. I will pick the items up from the post office when I return from France third week in April.  How soon can you start? I will email you the list and pictures of what to shop for so you can do the shopping at Sears,Walmart, Best buy and other stores. I'll pay you $300 for your service for 10 hours every week. I'm prepared to pay for living/travel expense.I will provide clear set of instructions for each task I need done and sufficient funds to cover all expenses. I'd love to meet with you upon my return from France to discuss the possibility of making this job long term. Well, let me know if you can do the Job.  Hope to hear from you soon.  Regards,  Robert Turner  This did not sit right with me so I started to research finding that there is in fact a Robert Turner under management of Adastra Corp. I sent an email to them to alert them of the email I had received:  Good evening ~ it is said if anything sounds too good to be true it probably is. I have done research and cannot believe that it  is in fact valid although I did find a Robert Turner under management on your website and at LinkedIn. I have not sent my response by return email as I want to confirm that this offer is valid or that this is a deal. I would wish it was valid yet want to ensure that I am not being sued.  I would appreciate your feedback if only to ensure that you are aware that this is in play on Craigslist      Also I would ask that you advise Robert Turner so that he is aware that his name is being used in this case as people that are not aware of this may believe it to be true. It did not sit right with me  although I would have been ready to accept this offer, so I researched it fully only for the search to prove more suspicious than not.   
I was sent an email offering a job from RonaldJordanpositionca@mail.com. He claimed to be from Escrow-Service Human Resources. I was offered the Customer Service Representative position at their new location in my city. I believed it to be an office job so I gave them my CV thinking it was legitimate.  After that email I received emails from  Hilary Swank at senior-manager@escrow-service.us. I was sent forms to fill out and send back, but also documents about the job responsibilities and about the company. The bill was very legal but some parts of it were done oddly but very professionally. it was with these documents and forms that the job went from an office or warehouse job to an at home job. The job turned out to be moving money around through a personal bank account.  I opened a new account so that my personal account couldn't be touched. I'd rather not think about what would have happened if I'd used my own account.  After sending instructions about being ready to work I wasn't getting any more instruction after being told to wait for a phone call that never came. I called again and got a repeated email which I replied to differently and when the reply came back odd I realized then that the emails were computer generated.  I still have all the documentation and emails and am willing to provide them should they be needed.
I met an owner of a "construction company" on a weekend coming home from a vacation and in need of a job.  He took a liking to me and gave me his business card and said if I wanted a job to give him a call.  I have a diploma in land surveying, and was expecting a job more along those lines, but almost immediately he wanted to make me a partner to his company (Fascina construction Inc.).  This was odd to me, but he seemed to be very genuine and said things like "I've always ran my business going by my gut" and "I see a lot of potential in you" etc.  So I decided to give it a chance. From the get go I told him I was exhausted (I am 22 with zero business experience) and wanted to take things slow.  He agreed, reassuring me that I'd have all the time I need to adjust and get comfortable with running the business and managing staff, saying it isn't that hard and I'd pick it up in no time.  I started off at $25 per hour and would be put on salary if I signed the partnership agreement.  So I started working for him, following him and helping him set up the "BC division" of the company. It didn't take long at all for him to start hitting me with high pressure sales tactics to get me to invest in the company and sign the partnership agreement.  He would say things like "this is your company too" to get me to sign for things and pay for expenses, promising I'd be ready for it at months eds or something like that... He was taking me to Austin and picked out two brand new premium trucks for us and had the sales people do a week's worth of work, pricing out a huge list of options (He never ended up getting those trucks).  We were meeting with Pete's, looking for a warehouse and office space to set up in.  There were multiple local businesses we were dealing with to get cars, equipment, furniture etc. and it all seemed above board.  he had shown me the certificate of incorporation, the number, last year's books and a host of other things trying to get me to sign.  He was over protective (not in a sexual way) and started saying things like "you're family" and "I'd do anything for you" in order to build trust I assume. Around the 2 week mark is when I was expecting my first check, but they supposedly messed up their direct deposit and they needed to "reduce their account".  He started paying me out of his pocket in small packets of $200.  This same payment style went on for about a month.  In that time I had agreed to sign the partnership agreement (he is very supportive).  My investment would be $2000 and a company vehicle, which we got from the same person working on the trucks. The car is a 2012 For approx $30,000 with taxes, rent, and everything else added on.  The company would lease it from me making that portion of my investment being my name and credit on the car. I started having doubts about the legitimacy of the business because we never seemed to do any real work, I still hadn't seen a computer, any other employees, equipment, or clients.  He hooked me with lots of madness...  I did some looking around some files in the office and I found a mortgage for his residence with a different first name on it.  A quick Google search brought me to a newspaper article from Terrace BC about a man with the same name as the mortgage papers and age of my "partner" involved with multiple counts of fraud with the local businesses.  I was shocked and went to the RCMP to try and find out what to do.  They weren't allowed to give me any details on him, but one sergeant told me off the record that they new him and told me to get out of the situation... I eventually confronted him and ended the business relationship and am currently trying to get back what is owed to me.  I have received my pay surprisingly enough, but the $2000 investment, credit card expenses and loan payments for the car are all being held back.  He has supposedly sent the payment for the credit card expenses twice via Canada post and post, but I haven't received them.  He was making the loan and insurance payments on the car (he signed a lease agreement with me) but this month he has been extremely difficult to deal with and still hasn't paid and it doesn't seem like he's going to. I am at a loss and don't know what to do, I cannot afford a lawyer and the cops were entirely useless beyond telling me they knew who he was.  Hopefully this will stop others from making the same mistakes as me and lead to some sort of justice.  There is more to the story but I don't have the time to get it all down... Thank you for you time.

I have my resume on several different job sites online. This company called Amersys Consulting called me and said I was hired. They wanted to transfer money to me and have me convert it into bit coin. They said they had an office in North Bay, ON, but were opening one here in a couple months.. 
Mark Sutherland, CEO of Static Beach hired radio hosts from all over North America to do shows from their home studios for his online radio station. I worked with Mark for over a year and at first, he would pay me on time and the correct amount. He fell behind on payments and asked if I would continue to do the work if he paid me off in small payments. I agreed to those terms until he stopped sending me checks completely and avoided me completely. I found out from his former business manager that I was not alone. It turns out Mark Sutherland is a con artist who gets people to do the work for him and simply does not pay them.
I'm the former host of 'More Music Mornings" The Heat, 106.3 Music. I stopped working for Joshua Jamison Eversole because he's a liar and a cheat. He fell behind on payments but I continued to do the show on good faith that Josh would eventually pay down his debt. Once I stopped working for him, he promised to pay me off in time. He now is simply refusing to pay and referred me to his lawyer. I know for a fact that I am now alone. I have proof and documentation of that. Josh is known for taking advantage of his employees on a regular basis. I'm going public with this because I don't want him hurting anyone else in this way.
Urban Concrete which owned by Khurban Ali Mukari located at Vancouver, BC has been charged me over six thousands dollar for work permit for my nephew who is leaving in abroad.

Contract they offer, you are to collect money from customers in your country and send to corporate. They had a customer transfer  $1000  to my bank account. I went to bank to collect money and send Western Union to them as instructed.. However when I arrived at bank my card was cancelled for possible fraud. Globex then requested I send to money to someone in eastern Europe not US corporate as expected.   I  then  called them and said it sounded crazy and would contact police. Never had a reply from them however they were able to recall the $1000 they sent me  and now I am blocked by interact and am trying to get the block removed
I reached out via the web to http://www.enigmaevaluators.com/shopper/ Within a few days I received an email and text from them to say that they were interested in employing me. They handed me a four pack along with details for how to start my employment. I called the number that they provided. They told me that they have activated the computer that was enclosed and I could start working the shopping assignments.  Over the course of the next week, I received two more classes and completed additional assignments. On Friday the first wave bounced. I called them, they advised that they would process details via western union to get me back my funds.  I needed to finish my final assignment and then the following day I would have the details for the western union. On Saturday I followed up with them. By 2:30 I had details.  The email indicated that it can take up to 24 hours for these funds to show. At this time the funds are still not available and now I am taking steps to prevent others from making my mistakes.

Applied to a few sites online for mystery player positions. I was contacted my phone about 2 weeks later, and was told I was selected to be a secret member. No interview, nothing. Then I was told I would be receiving a training manual and a list of jobs along with a certified fee of approximately $2000 dollars for those jobs as well as an advanced check being sent with USPS and that I would be given a tracking number. It all seemed very suspicious and lined up with what I have read about these days.

this company got my information from ZipRecruitor when I applied for a job online. I received and email that asked me to click a link - when I did, it triggered my anti-virus. When I called the person who offered me a job at $35/hour he didn't even know who I was. WHen I confronted him that he was a liar - he pretended not to understand what I was talking about and hung up on me. Later when I called back, no one answered. This company is pretending to be another company. Example - there is a private company online called FUTURE LEADERS EXCHANGE SERVICES (FLEX). The same company has the same title EXCEPT with the logo of FLES. BE WARNED THIS IS A!!!!

 i received this information in regard to possible employment.I am concerned it may not  now be a legitimate Company or offer.   i am concerned because I am being asked to use my personal bank account during the holiday period. 
They employed me as a project coordinator. Transactions were done via email, no interview done. I did work part time because I felt that it was good, the work was to research on schools and how international students can come in to Canada. I think they help international families by recruitment of their kids with the promise of being able to study in Canada Our last correspondence involved an e-transfer from a certain Anita Robichaud that they said I should deposit to my account which will be used for new students that arrived in Toronto. They handed me the e-transfer email to me.
McBee Finance: Our son applied to McBee Finance of Vancouver for a job in Halifax (new branch). This company appears to be a fraud (Scam Tracker), although website exists (mcbeefinance.com). No company found in it. They asked for and received personal information and scan of driver's license, although our son stopped when asked for banking info.
As an employer entering our busy season we required a casual worker/driver to work in our plant  in late October 2015. We had placed an online ad through Target in Sydney and were contacted via email by the labour agency GTA Employment who said they had something available to us. Coincidentally and at the same time a person looking for work had uploaded their resume to indeed.com. When we called GTA Employment about their worker they sent him over the next day. The problem is that the worker had never applied to GTA Employment to represent him  they somehow got a hold of his resume and sent him to us. He never was asked to visit their business to fill out any employment forms or be signed up for work. He started to work for us through GTA Employment - he received his 'pay' in cash payments delivered to our business. Feeling nervous about this business like practice I was told by one of their top 'professionals' that the worker was considered a 'contractor' and so was not on regular basis with limited source information. I find this highly irregular and while I can't prove anything I think this individual has been short paid.
I got a job offer over the internet that I did not apply for. They said the company name was Pausa Financial and they were from Malta, but would be moving into the Main Building downtown.. 
I applied for a Mystery Shopping job online through INDEED last month.  A week or so ago I received a call from Prime Evaluation Consultants, Mary White stating that I was approved to work for their company and they would be sending me a package by UPS containing the job instructions.  I received the package yesterday.  The package included a welcome letter and 2 Royal Bank shares drawn the Co-operators Insurance Company for $2,750.00. They contacted me by phone to review and to send me to the  bank and conduct my first shops.  I explained that I am leaving for Cuba tomorrow and I could not do anything until I return on March 7th.  She was fine with that and asked me to hold the wheel until I return and she gives me further instructions. I contacted the fraud unit at the Co-operators Insurance company and Peter Brand stated that these charges are valid. I am willing to work with the police if they would like to try to catch these people as they think I am able to work for them after March 7th.
  I was given a Mystery House job offer.  " The letter included a US $2000 check drawn on the TD bank and made out by the Wholesale Stores - a legitimate company located in Mississauga.  " The letter included a phone number to call in for a security code to activate the check.  " The letter was signed by a Henry Graham. . The envelope had no return address but the fake letter gave an 813 King Street address in Victoria, BC (British Columbia) which turns out to be the location of a 7-eleven store. .   
The company name is Strike Consults from Ottawa, ON phone# 1.888.569.8450 or 1.613.413.6014. I applied for a job on Workopolis for an office Admin assistant. Sam Peters sent me a email to tell me that they had reviewed my resume and they wanted to offer me the job. They told me that I don't have to interview for the job because anyone can do well on a interview and my there resume look good but they was going to give me a job an put me on a 90-days probation. The job pays $1,000 a week after taxes and getting paid bi-weekly. Monday-Friday 9-5 with all benefits included. He stated they were expanding the company in my city and would be officially open March 1st but i was to work at home for the month of February until everything was finalized. He also sent me n email telling me he was going to send a check for me to buy the office supplies and inventory that is needed but never once told me the address or much information on the company. Sam also told me to contact him via email as soon as i received the check and that i was to report to him only and wait for further instruction. Red flags -  I couldn't find information about the company online, he cannot find anything about the company and the address is some random building, he ask for my address which is on my resume (and he stated he had) and know company is going to send you money to buy an entire office worth of inventory.
I applied for a job on Indeed and a month later, I was contacted by what I thought was a legitimate company, and I did do some information about the company and only found a site for community lend, which is now known as finance it, since I was really looking for a job and I didn't really feel as though I had a good enough credit for anyone to use, I called even after calling the office number, which never went through. I later realized I was being stupid when they kept asking me for information I should have provided in person. I stopped responding to the emails and since then, they've not called me back, but I've been worried because I did give out my social and drivers license. so I decided to report this so that no one else would fall for this
I applied for a job on indeed with this "company." They replied back saying that my resume proves for a better paid position.. so I went with it and filled out the application. They said that there would be a probation period during which I would be working from home to prove I was cut out for the job in lieu of a formal interview so it was already sounding suspicious given that they said they would pay me via e-transfer and I hadn't filled out any Tax Forms like for other jobs. I decided to investigate their website only to find it was not secured or verified like other sites are and had no "https" address. I then investigated the alleged Chief Assistant (Michelle Tonna)and Development manager (Oliver Pasani) on Monday. Neither of them had a profile picture or any other connections apart from her. I then came across a story on a death warning blog from an individual with a story nearly identical to mine.  I also checked the address they provided on their website for their headquarters which yielded conflicting results. I have cut off contact since then and will not be touching them again.
I was contacted by Preston Kemp from Durham Solutions Shop Evaluators, a Mystery Shopping evaluating firm.  He sent me an email and we talked on the phone a few times.  He then handed me a check and told me to deposit it and once it had cleared I was to contact him again. He gave me a mystery shop assignment.  However, the check had been returned by the bank.  I called Preston on Thursday the 11th to advise him of that and have not heard back from him since and have not been able to get through to anyone via phone or email. Although I have not given them any personal details other than my email address, I cannot figure out what they are getting out of this.
Youth Leadership Programs contacted me with a job offer.  They claimed they saw my resume on careerbuilders.ca.  The job was for a Project Coordinator that paid over $25 per hour for the two week probation period.  The position was a work from home opportunity, however nothing was mentioned about computer or internet speed requirements.  The organizations address is 414 - 1660 Main St, Dallas, ON ,N.  The gentleman I dealt with went by the name of Scott Long. Thank you,

I am looking for work and posted my resume on Workopolis and applied for several positions as an Administrative Assistant. Twice already she tried to abuse this situation. One was from Nova Scotia called  http://www.huaconsults.com/ This happened in the The other just yesterday http://alixpartners.com/EN/ Interestingly the latter company really exists,  when you could search the website they post in the letter/ job description. I called their offices in San Francisco, but the person who answered did not know anyone by the name that signed the job offer. It was the usual way here it what they want..... work scheme description  : work part time from home, make 1000 dollars a week, be in charge of calling in 'funds owed to the company' and send it to 'headquarters'. That I know what is going on and would never fall for something like this. But I worry about other persons desperate for a job in the current unemployment situation.
I was sent a check, and the check was then bounced right out of my account with all my money. I was offered a stay at home job, but needed a credit card.
Workers are now using job sites like Facebook to convince people they are hired and they advance money to them for 'working materials' in the form of a fee.  They insist you deposit the check in an ATM (not through a dealer), withdraw the money to be carried onward to someone else. The letters they send are fake and PLEASE DO NOT CASH them!!!  You will be liable to the bank to pay the bank back, and in the worst case, most likely have your accounts closed and unable to open new accounts anywhere else, and possibly be charged or investigated for money stealing. Some tips when job hunting online: 1) ask for confirmation of whom you are talking to - ask at the very least for a employee ID card from the employer 2) get their location and verify it. 3) ensure they are communicating from their corporate email address.  Using a free service like Yahoo, or GMail is a good tell tale sign they are fake, and/or if they use free chat apps like Yahoo to 'interview you'. 4) never advance money to an potential employer.  If they don't provide what you need to do your job, they probably are not legitimate 5) watch especially for 'work at home' opportunities.  These are easy targets to hide suspicious trends in their state 6) especially watch since the job market is not the most favorable in areas with job losses  these schemes prey on those in dire times.  Be careful.
The company name is Mini Computer Systems from Toronto, ON phone# 647-785-2185. I applied for a job on career builder for an office assistant. Alex Kirsten Operation Manager sent me a email to tell me that they had reviewed my resume and they wanted to offer me the job. They told me that I don't have to interview for the job because anyone can do well on a interview and my there resume look good but they was going to give me a job an put me on a 90-days probation. The job pays 1200.00 a week get paid bi-weekly. Monday-May 9-5 with all the benefits that I would get from you would get at any job. He stated where is was going to open the business Then he sent a email telling me that they was going to send a check for supplies and stuff that is need for the office but never once did he say a lot about the busy that they was opening. The only thing he said that he need to get the office set up by July 24.  So the check was receive this week and a letter came with it. So once I got the letter and the check I had a lot of questions to asked so I email him back the questions. The next morning I call the bank that the cash check  was from they said that it was not real. I also call the city where they said that they were going to open a there business in the US they said that never heard of the company. So Alex finally call an I told him that the bank said that the check is not real he said yes it is and I told him that the city don't know anything about his company coming to Memphis he said that they are still work on the paperwork. 1st Flag- couldn't find information about the company on line. 2nd Flag For the address it comes up with an old build not like the one of the web page. 3rd Flag when you ask for my address and you said that you have my resume with the address on it. 4th Flag no company is going to sent you money and don't know nothing about you.
 I applied for a job online and soon after I was sent an email saying I was hired. They didn't want to interview me or anything. They wanted a copy of my drivers license, SIN number and bank account information..    They said I should take money from their company, put it into my own account and then send it on to another account. This seemed really weird to me..   They said their name was Terrcorp  Global Consulting and the person who wrote the email was named Robert Potts..

was sent a check by a supposed marketing company for $1485.00 to be used for reference to my assignments. deposit card in my account was cleared by my bank after 5 days. Don t me the news was not good!
I got a text message the other day from "Bobby Brown".  The text said I could earn up to $500 per mystery murder job.  I sent the text back showing interest.  He then sent me an email with his name and underneath Brown Services logo.  He said they were looking to hire me as a mystery writer.  All I had to do was send him my name, phone#, email, mail address.  I sent him this info.  He got back to me this morning and said I was hired and they would be sending me a check for $500 and once I received the check I was to go to the bank and cash it and then let him know once it was deposited and they would send me my assignment to go to one of the banks he mentioned in the email and do an evaluation as they had been reported as giving poor service to customers.  The original area code he texted me from was 902 which is US or PEI.  I went on, but could not find this company.  I                                                                                                                  as it named 4 new companies who work out of Canada.  I also found it suspect that he did not have a link to their website in the email if a new company.  I sent him an email back and told him I would not be paying them unless he sent me legal proof of their business based on my previous research of the company which looks similar.

I went online to do a silent phone jobs. I have done before. I found a site. I applied and received an email. They handed me out a package with a check. I did the other job and it was for your visa. Pre paid visa. They sent me a letter. But the pictures are fake.. They even were talk on the phone with me and everything.
Hello, I don't know how to answer this, the options to chose from don't match. I applied to a job add for an administrative position in indeed.ca under a company called Gold Consults who claimed to be opening up new offices in Calgary. I had a very brief telephone interview today, which I assumed was a preliminary interview. A couple of days ago, I received another email saying that I got the job, but it was the most unusual and strange letter. It had asked me for my full name, address and phone number, so that they could send me money too book hotels, books and software. When I asked for more information, they stopped answering. After I looked into their company, it's hard to find on a Google search, you can only find it when you search Gold Coast in in Toronto. They don't even provide a postal code on their website and so, when you call the telephone number on their site no one answers and there is no legitimate voice mail. The police didn't get anything more than my resume because I caught on fast that something was weird. Please do check into it before it happens to someone else.
I am       getting this mail from India. Three days ago I received a mail for an employment. The employer name is "Joepa" who is situated in the below address. 112 Main street West Toronto, ON,W, Canada. Their web address is bontem.page4.me. They themselves claims to be the largest component manufactures in Canada and other countries too. After reading the mail I had the following doubts. 1. Without conducting an interview or any kind of interaction they sent me an appointment letter and contract letter. So how they access me that whether I am suitable for their post or what. 2. Look at their website address. their domain name ends in ".me". They don't even have a valid domain name. Their website looks too odd. 3. More doubtful is their processing procedure. it is given below. the interview is been held at the last step that too after receiving 545 Indian Dollars from us.   LMIA-Labour Market Impact Assessment letter released.  At this point applicant pay the Sponsor security amount only to the broker from applicant country selected by Human resources and social development of Canada- Labour department (NDP) in a letter if its positive.   Work permit released after LMIA.   Medical certificate released after work permit.   Interview with Company delegation than Visa endorsement after medical.   Ticket on availability and immigration clearance letter.
I went to a site for Mining Canada looking for job openings. The site took my personal information including a detailed description of my work history for the past three years. I selected next from a table then a screen comes up saying I have to pay 214.00 dollars to continue. I had no idea there would be charges from the initial page. Now they have a portion of my life stored somewhere and I want it back. When you click on the "contact us" app to contact someone all you get is select payment option. Seems scary as hell so I contacted him. This is the only point of contact I could find and I sent them an email demanding my info returned and to identify to me where it went. MININGED Email: info@mining-canada.com 170-422 High Street Vancouver, BC Canada BC : : I started from a Goggle search for "Mining Jobs in Canada" and I selected it because it was associated with Indeed.com, which is typically not associated with crap like this. I went back to the initially page you are brought to and they do tell you there is a fee in the fine print. under terms and conditions. Here is the link, you decide. http://www.mining-canada.com/?G1?li=Cj0KEQiAlO20BRCcieCSncPlqqMBEiQAOZGMnKB8w41rkEXMUOxDp89eeKquQLEGOaAXs1aZxQAx0CYaAhrV8P8HAQ I really got the feeling I was sending my info to possible employers.
I received an email on a job that i applied for on indeed.ca this person has been calling me saying that he will be sending me my first weeks pay and assignment. I've done some research and can't find the company on any web search. the phone number that he gave me does not accept phone calls just text messages. the "companies" name is hammerconstrutionlife.
they sent me a letter that did not have a return address on it and doesn't have a mark it was send by the postal office.  The letter states me to go to the stores they have listed and to buy stuff and keep the records and there is a check enclosed. Also they ask to do a money transfer and money grams. to two different places.
the address of this business is listed as our hotel address which is not the case. They call and offer too good to be true jobs or services.  The web site is listed as our address. We have received multiple calls regarding this and advise the person to just be aware and contact you or the Police.  We want them to remove our information
I received an email from a company claiming to be Secret Agent. They were looking for people to work as mystery hunters. I indicated I was interested as I was out of work. I was then asked to send my resume to them. I handed my resume to them. They asked for more info. My full name, address and bank that I dealt with. They asked what I was doing if I was working. I indicated I was unemployed. They indicated that they would mail a check for $400. to me and once I receive it I was to cash it and complete my first assignment. I was given instructions to choose a bank and report how the service was. The car was supposed to cover any meals and money if I had to drive anywhere. I have all the emails saved. I received a check for $1,983.70 in the mail with further instructions. The letter head appeared questionable as well I have not signed any kind of contract or documents to be mystery solved. My spouse is an attorney he indicated to me that I should contact the Police and the Better Business Bereau as it appears to be a case. The cash is from Canada Life Financial Corporation. I didnot cash the check so they weren't able to get any -money from me. I sent a photo of the house but I have a photo of the letter too. Contact name is: John Dalton hr@mysteryshopers.org. My contact number is                                                                                                                                           
I responded to a job posting ad on Workopolis. The company was looking for an administrative assistant to help set up a satellite office in my city. The job supposedly pays $1000 weekly. I responded and received a two minute "pre-screen" phone call from someone from the company asking me a couple vague questions. Then I received an email offering me the job and wanting my full legal name, address, and phone number, so they can mail me a check to start purchasing office supplies and furniture. The website looks fake, the company is not located at the address provided and unable to verify any of the information on the 'fake' website, and the only information about this company is job listing.

I posted an advertisement for part-time house cleaning in Kijiji.  When I least expected, I received an email from a man in Washington State telling me that he will be moving to Windsor, Ontario with his family for a limited time as he has been hired to do some kind of research.  I looked up this man's name on the internet and I saw that he is a very well known and educated person.  I was impressed by his creative writing.  He wrote that they were a great family, that he has one child and one along the way and that he needed someone to help his wife twice a week with cleaning, running around and so on.  I may add that the pay was good. He wrote that they were moving to London after the Christmas holidays.  After a few weeks of going back and forth, he sent me a list of items to buy and a check for $1,940 to cover the cost.  Since I was not comfortable in buying merchandise for someone else I told him to buy his own when they arrive.  In the meantime, I deposited his name into my bank account.  A day or so late, I received an email inviting me to send this money to his landlord, who was living in Mississippi because the house he was going to rent still needed some renovations and he had to pay for them.  He said to keep $50.00 for myself for my trouble but being an honest person I proceeded to send the whole amount to his future landlord via Western Union as instructed.  Lo and me, I almost laughed when the bank called to inform me that the check which he sent me bounced.  Happily the bank gives me this money because, quote "I have been a loyal customer for many years".  I contacted the police and they are passing this information on to the OPP in charge of the "fraud" department. PS - On closer look, the letter that was sent to me from the bank had a Quebec address.
This company sent my husband two fake checks of $22,640 and  asked him to keep 7% and send them the rest of the money.

I got a text message from an anonymous number at around 3:38 in the morning of December 29. They said it was an ad about an opportunity to become a secret worker at some drug sale and it will earn me $400 per evaluation. They sent me an email address asked me to send in my personal info and postal code. But I had a feeling that this email address is not right, so I searched for some secret society from online and I found some similar reports in Ontario and Manitoba. I'm definitely sure that the text message is a fake.
Contacted by email by someone reported to be representing MBRConscious Inc, named Alan Smith, offering me an at home computer job. I was sent a bank transfer for $4000 and told to deposit it and subsequently send money to the computer vendor. I was instructed to send several amounts to the same vendor. I realized that something was wrong and terminated my association with the caller. The money deposited to my bank was declared and so I was out the money.
Received the attached letter to my home email address on Dec. 24th/2015  pm, in response to a undisclosed company, job posting on Workopolis. Could not find Frank McCoy on LinkedIn.  The 1800 search comes up as located in the USA, and Canada. The physical address on the letter turns out to be the Courtyard Hotel in Halifax.  Could not find HUA Consults under the law. With all this being said, I'm concerned for other people fallen victim to these types of job losses.
I work with a participant who was offered a position as a "funds manager", he had money deposited into his bank account and was told to take the money out in cash and send funds to another individual through Western Union. All had to be done within the same business day.
  I had a company claiming to be with All State insurance contact me about three years ago, they wanted me to work from home and were going to send me $10,000.00 to pay for the computer they were going to send me... all I had to do was deposit the check into my personal bank account, and write a check for the computer when it came.  
I was contacted through indeed.com to work from home with you. I was given an interview over Google Hangouts, a letter of job offer, etc. The company is real, the names of employees are real, but the job offer and everything else about it was fake. I only found out once I called the company and spoke to the real person.
Man saying name is John Rues put add in local paper for a personal assist. For past month or so have been sending emails. Said he was given first class. Then just got an email asking for all my banking info. Including where I will attach email address( john.rues@aol.com)
I responded to a job posting ad on Workopolis. The company was looking for an administrative assistant to help set up a satellite office in my city. The job supposedly pays $1000 weekly. I responded and received a two minute "pre-screen" phone call from someone from the company asking me a couple vague questions. Then I received an email offering me the job and wanting my full legal name, address, and phone number, so they can mail me a check to start purchasing office supplies and furniture. The website looks fake, the address seems like it's to another company, and the only information about this company is job listing.
I was contacted through email regarding a job because I originally applied for a job in their company. They called me and said hey had something better as per my qualifications on my resume. After they asked me to sign an application form and thereafter a form detailing my compensation and duties during the first of two consecutive waiting periods, they sent me money via email transfer and asked me to go to a Bitcoin ATM and deposit the money there for the next task they asked me to do. There was minimal intact via phone and mostly all done through email. I have not accepted the money sent to me and when asked twice amazing if I had received the money, and once through a follow up email, I knew that I shouldn't follow through with it.
Morgan Investments contacted me to evaluate some stores. They sent me a check for $1000 and asked me to wire some of the money back to them, but I haven't done the details yet.
I would like to report the website by the name of VisibleQuiz.com. They do online surveys and offer $18 per survey. Their website claims that they will pay the money once the balance reaches $1000 (I assume it is not). They claim that the payment will be done next month, which means if I did surveys in November and reached the said balance the money will be paid in December through May. I check the website once in a while and they are claiming that they paid out a lot of money to people who did surveys on November 30,2015, which they did not, because I would be one of the people who received a payment, which I did  not. I want to know what measures I need to take to close this little website and also to warn others. I wasted my money on the earnings I should have received and I am having big money problems right now. I don't want anyone going through the same thing.
Gate Offshore, based in Panama City, offered me a job that I didn't apply for. I would work from home and meet clients. First they wanted me to sign an employment contract and attach a copy of my drivers license. After I filed the document, they asked for my bank information, including daily withdrawal limits. That prompted me to ask for more details about the company and the position. I haven't heard from them since.

When I called them to ask what is this all about? they replied congratulated me that I was selected to act as a mystery worker with my employee number and the pay rate per hour for the assignment. And they asked me to send them my Name, address, phone number  and  age. And just recently I received a letter together with a letter. They listed the breakdown of how the check will be spent once I clear it with my bank and the funds available.                                             
   "   I received a secretive job offer in the mail from "Corporate Research Group" in Edmonton 888-612-0840. Included was a $3992 check draw on the Banque Royale du Canada, $3152 of which I was suppose to wire to a Walter Anderson at 844-425-5482  and keep the rest..   
I received the initial offer from MFX Investment Co to be a Shopping Evaluator via my cell phone. The compensation offered was $300 per assignment. I would evaluate stores, banks, etc. as to their customer service. I applied to the email given  and  recently received a letter that I  had qualified  and  had been approved to be a Mystery Writer. The letter was supposedly from a company called MFX Investments. However, the lease enclosed for $2343.90 was signed by a different company, Mawer Investment Management Co, in Calgary, Alberta. They asked that I deposit the check in my bank account by Dec/15  and  send them a copy of the deposit account. I suspected that this was not legitimate so I contacted the Calgary Better Business Bureau. They responded  and  told me the steps I needed to take to verify that it was a valid offer. The first recommendation was to contact Mawer Investments to determine if they were part of the Shoppers Evaluation Program  and  if they were affiliated with MFX Investments. I did this today  and  spoke with the Chief Operating Financial Officer. She confirmed that this is indeed a case  and  that they have no affiliation with MFX Investments whatsoever. She had received 5 other phone calls about this offer. She asked that I scan the page, letter  and  the envelope it came in  and  send it to her. She also asked if I would speak to the RCMP if she gave them my name. I, of course agreed. Anything I can do to make other people especially seniors like me aware that this is not legitimate  and  to not deposit the cash into ones bank account. Once they have the copy of the deposit slip, then they will have your banking information  and  a worse scenario I cannot imagine.
I was contacted by phone to sign up with a company called The Pro from Tucson Arizona they wanted me to pay a fee to do online marketing from home
The lawyer first told me they found my application on indeed. I did not recall applying to this job, but the offer was tempting.  The lawyer under the name "Harry Robertson" then proceeded to send me emails regarding my application instructions and told me I got the job. I filled out the application and then got to a section which asked me to fill out sensitive information like banking locations and email money transfers. I immediately knew what was happening. I felt enraged that these people are able to get away with this.
 Below is what was sent to me via email after I had applied for an administrative assistant position.  The company has a fraud warning at the bottom of their careers page so I showed the email to them and they informed me that this is a fraud email.

Not sure if so but just seemed strange.....got email asking to sign contract, give passport and DL (scan and send to them) to work from home. I have kept email - noticed spelling mistakes....sorry not sure how to send it to you.
I was contacted by James Moore, Project Manager of Customer Consult LTD several months ago via my personal email account.  He said I fit the profile of the type of persons they are looking for to fill part time Silent Shopper positions.  I am an employed senior citizen. They requested my age, type of employment and home address to determine if I indeed qualified.  I thought nothing of it and wanted more information about the offer.  I received a few emails from them over a period of a couple months, and was eventually advised in a "congratulatory" email that they would like to have me work with them and that they would be in touch. Weeks went by until a couple weeks ago when I received an email saying I would receive a "package" in the post with full instructions to begin my assignment.  The package was a letter in a plain white envelope and contained what appears to be a legitimate check in the amount of $4,487.10.  That caused me to think twice and look into this further.  The return address on the envelope is P.O. Box 9009, Ottawa, ON K1G1.  The card is issued by British Columbia Investment Management Corp (BC), with address: 301-2940 Douglas Road. Victoria, BC, V8T5K6. The bank account: The Bank Of Nova Scotia, Canada  and  Oak, 1004 W Broadway, Vancouver, BC, $1. Account # 023830 20370 002 02060 16. I was told to deposit the check, then send an email immediately when that was done. I DID NOT deposit the funds.  I sent an email saying I would not deposit the check because I suspected a leak and would check with the authorities.  That was two days ago.  I have yet to hear back from the Project Manager. The letter which arrived with the letter is omitted.  The letter says only: Project Manager Universal Consult. admin@universalconsultltd.com In God We Trust Too good to be true is always the best bet on a scale.

Sent email asking for info on how to be a mystery writer, sent email back to me asking for money. Again, red flags.

I received confirmation from a company BVT Consults that I had been selected as an Administrative Assistant for their new office opening in Calgary. They sent me a "certified check " and I want to let you know this is a deal. I took the check to the bank it was from and they advised me it is not good.  The license was from Dominion Citrus Limited. Do not give these people your banking information.  Do not send them back the deposit slip if you have deposited the check as you are liable for it.
Offer of Employment Person:  Vince Wood  ( Telephone # 902-800-0049 ) Office: Anapolis Group Inc., 380 Bedford Highway, Atlanta,,M. I called  Anapolis where Mr. Wood was supposed to have an office, they said there is no John Wood or World Student Exchange and that many students have called from around the world to visit.  They also informed me that this is a case that draws lots of students and it is a joke. Finally, I decided to call the Rental Office before going forward, 2 days  after deciding to work for Mr. Wood.
I was told the position I applied for on Indeed was no longer available but they had another position as Billing Clerk. I was to start December 23 in a new office in Calgary, After sending me an application to fill out they wanted banking info for direct deposit. I did not give them any banking info.
 1. Applied to an advertisement in the paper for a Mystery Movie.    2. Received phone call from Scott Madison of Shoppers Voice Canada, who gave me a phone interview on Monday, June 27. The pay would be $100 per  per visite.    3. Scott called back on Tuesday, July 27th saying that he would like to offer me the job but I would have to be trained first. He said that a package would be arriving the following morning. Since I had a previously scheduled meeting at 2:00 PM, we agreed to call at 3:00.    4. The package arrived before I left for my meeting. It included a cover letter and a bank draft from  the Tangerine Bank Group. The draft was for the amount of $2,256.00. At 3:00, on July 29th, I called Scott and he told me to proceed to my bank with the check and deposit it and withdraw $1,100. He said we would need that amount for the first portion of the  new mystery shopping training. §     5. I was then told to proceed to the library in Manchester and, in particular, the Technical Department. Scott said to ask to speak to an employee and ask for something that I wasn't necessarily familiar with (but that I was familiar with). Then I was told to purchase something worth between $20 and $30 from the $1,100. When I was talking to the employee about one of the cables, he made a mistake on the price, so, I jumped at purchasing that cable, even though it was over the $30 because it was a great deal. So, my first purchase was for $39.99 plus tax.    6. I was then told to go to the files inside Atlanta and describe what happened. Then I was told to go to Western Union that was within reach. I was to go get a  light green formup  and go back to school to fill it out  again  with his direction. He had the wire going to Fitz Chalifour  and  he said it was a generic name that he was getting off of a list. He said to put that he lived in Ajax, ON. And, we were going to send him $940.00 cash. I went over to the Western Union desk and the money was sent. Once that was done, I was asked for the number on the last s  along with other information about the transaction.    7. After that, I was asked to go to Metro in Barrhaven and buy $20 to $30 in bread and pay particular attention to the bakery department because they had complaints about bread being sold. So, I bought a few things and spent $35. Then when I was leaving the store, he called me to see how things were. He asked a few things about the outside of the store. Then he asked me to do another Western Union transfer. He gave me some information  and  again going to the fictitious city family but this time he lived in Toronto, Ontario and the phone number I was given was 613-769-1966. This time, the $940.00 came out of my bank account from the remainder of the Bank Draft noted above.    8. Once that transaction was completed, then I was asked to head over to Shopper Drug s Drug Mart and purchase a Vanilla Visa Card in the amount of $150. He then asked me for the number on the back of the card so that they could use the Visa Card.    9. I was asked to put the letters from Western Union and the Visa into an envelope and send it to Kevin Washington at 20 Blue Bell Way, Toronto, ON, ON7.    10. They had made a mistake by not sending me another check the following day as it is their preference that the training is held on three consecutive days. When that opportunity was missed, the long weekend was upon us so, they had to wait until Tuesday, August 4th. That is when two more cars arrived. One in the amount of $2,256 and one for $2,356. That is when we realized that the first coin had bounced, which meant that I was out $2,256.00. If I had done this for three consecutive days, I would have been wiped out of $6,868!!    11. This violent activity has been reported to the police and the report number is 15-196135. Since then, the records that were sent to "Blue Sky Way" were returned. Today, I received a text from my INVESTMENTS - phone number - 613-793-5538. It read as follows: "My INVESTMENTS are currently hiring Shoppers in Canada. Earn $300 per evaluation. If interested, send names to: info@mfxinvestments.com." I believe that this text could be related to the previous Shoppers Voice Canada ad.    .  
How to make more money, "30 Day Change"
 I applied for the position of Executive Special Assistant with TipTop Energy. Spark Hire contacted me to do a video interview. The next day I was contacted by John Adams (     info@tiptopenergy.ca ) saying I had the job and a check was being handed to me to use the Calgary office for its new  to 23  2016 opening. I replied asking where/when the office would be opened and what was the code for specifically. This was his reply:           "Dear     ,     You will begin to run ads for the company starting from this week and you will be included on the company rolls immediately. The contract agreement will be finalized/signed on last d, 23rd of November.    The full details regarding your employment duties, salary, bonus, benefits and vacation time will be spelled out in the contract.   The account department had sent a check to your address and it will be delivered by UPS by  tomorrow. This is the tracking number..                   . You can track the status at :  www.ups.com.   The store is meant for the purchase of office furniture and inventory. You have been expected to handle the payment for the order as well as to receive the furniture when it gets delivered to the office.   I would like you to inform me immediately you receive the letter. Further instructions will be provided to you in regards to what needs to be done. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to call, text or send an email.    New    Regards,   John Adams    1-6859 "     I received a short text this morning from John Adams with this phone number advising to inform him once I received the call. I tracked the UPS and it says there will be delivery today.    The website ( http://www.tiptopenergy.ca/  home.html ) seems suspicious as well.  
I had posted messages on "INDEED" and JOB BOOM looking for employment as a Transport driver supervisor, or as a truck driver. Received an email stating that they had seen my resume and that I would be perfect for the job. The job is selling life insurance. The catch is they want approx. $500.00 and to cover processing fees and training supplies etc. The first months are training and there is no income. I did a Google search and there is a lot of info about these places online.

I was contacted by a Muztagh Travel and Tours offering me a large amount of money to be an " accounts receiving agent" for people traveling to China. They are asking for my full name, full address, phone number, car number, cell number, age, sex and my personal email address.
She received an offer for a job at home starting at eight. Then she sent all her information as requested in the employment application log. and is now waiting for a background check. Sounded crazy to me, so after investigating a little online it seems like its a lot going around.
World Student Exchange (WSE) has offered me a high paying position but I cannot find any really information on this company.  They are using an address in Halifax, NS and a phone number that goes right to them.  They are asking me for personal information, bank account information.  They sent me a job offer letter.  When I asked for more information regarding the company and program, I got two run around emails with little information.  Almost looks like a copy and paste email.  They used OCE in Hamilton, ON as a partner to post the job add.  I applied for the position 20 days ago but the website/domain name was only created on October 29th, 2015.  No other information is found on the Internet and nothing was registered with the FBI.  I have all the emails I was sent.
World Student Exchange offered me a job that I applied for but did not ask me for any form of interview.   They claim the role is Operations Manager in Markham. The offer is $29 per hour and they say it's to find suitable homes for exchange students. I cannot find a profile for either representative online I also cannot find an office in Markham belonging to this organization.
Hello, I wish to report a case. A small company - Shell Energy and Gas - has been posting job details around the web. My aunt applied for it, filling in a simple questionnaire and within days received a particularly good 'job offer' to her email. The company claims to be from Austin, Texas. However there is no record of them anywhere but their own website (www.seanenergyandgas.com) - and that domain has only existed since April of this year (my agent was contacted in May). I have also noticed that all the content on the website was stolen from another legitimate UK business, changing only the name  and  addresses. After a few emails, my aunt was told she needed to pay $1500 USD for a US work visa, to be wired to India via Moneygram. Luckily, I have persuaded my aunt not to go for it just yet, however she is still pinning hopes. The correspondence has become more demanding and horrible in the mean time. I can see online that many other customers have had the same emails and demands for $1000 Visa payments, the same same living on mass. These searches don't seem to be limited to just this one website. They have created other similar gas sites such as Greathon Energy and Gas, Devon Energy and Gas, Somerset Energy and Gas... all far from what people say on the internet. It is a really sad and anxious thing to see someone you love falling prey to evil people like this because they are vulnerable and eager to work.

The game is based on world financial group, which is an organization with apparently the mission to help families secure stable funds. The odd part is that is based on a. System of people who work as financial advisors with the company who have to recruit and make sales. The company focuses more on the recruiting part. You also have to be a member and only after you sign the papers are you told about having to recruit others.
A generic email was sent to me. The writer wanted someone to represent Ono Pharmaceuticals to collect outstanding fees for 5% commission. I would then collect the money owing, put it into my personal bank account and then send it on to Ono Pharmaceuticals. There was no job interview or contract.. 
It's listed a Indeed.com with job listing. The job I applied to was with Hopstones Food. The called me on a new number, showed up as an Albany, Georgia number to offer me the job. When I said but you didn't interview me and when do I meet you? You said that we don't need to do that and we'll send you some forms to fill out. She said I can't hear you, the connection is bad. The email was asking for my passport/ driver license, ID and payment form. I never was given a contact number and her call was brief. She never used her last name. The email domain she used was at indeed.com. At the bottom of the ad posting, it said: easily applied. There are now 2 additional jobs with the same: easily applied. One that really stands out is Mina Limited because Minacs is a huge company and it is not a limited. They try to create an image that they are that Minacs which people know. Hopstone Foods has a website and also in the job description it all appears that they trade: export to Japan and they have a local office. I was never given the local address but their home is in Ukraine.
I was contacted through linked by Cody Hobbs for a possible employment 2  weeks ago. I was hooked up with a second person. I have requested to meet with someone from PetroChina in Calgary. instead this lady wanted me to sign a message of understanding along with a copy of SIN no. and a copy of my drivers license.

I received an email asking if I want to be a mystery hunter. I said yes. Later I received a check in the mail from McNally House Hospice. I thought it was odd the phone would be coming from a charity so I called.  They said it wasn't sent by them. I didn't cash the check.
I was told my resume was recommended to them from Monster.com. They are a business in Canada and are opening up an office in Downtown Long Beach, CA (US). They offered $27 an hour for an Administrative Assistant position. I went through one phone interview and was told it was between me and another person. I was then sent a letter two days letter offering me the position and what it may contain. After further investigating because I felt something was off I realized it may be a trap. Their website only offers the same phone number and email address that was calling me. There was not a general office phone number. The "Deputy Director" was able to text from the number posted online so I figured it was a personal line. The site also doesn't offer much information. I then called the company and nothing was coming up. I looked up the address and it is a building that allows many companies to rent out offices so I could not verify that they were actually there. I received a quick check in the mail so that "I could go get the supplies for the office to make their transition to a new location easier." Once the check came I looked up the bank online and called them. The representative could not find a check with the date and amount that I provided. She then asked where it came from and how. I said Canada and the mail. She immediately said it was fraud. It was also signed by Woodrow Wilson. I also looked up the FBI Director's name and could not find anything on him. All together, the person's ultimate goal was to save me.
This card is a job opportunity that uses a prolonged period of testing to ask for your banking information in order to place money into your account, at which time they will test your "skills" for the job. It seems to be a money making scheme. I called the address listed to ask if First Travels was operating from the Signature Business Center in Toronto, and was contacted stating that there was no business of such name within the SBC, or that was planning to be in that building, and that they had receive calls about this company already.

This "employer" claims to give you money to transfer funds from your own bank account through a cash machine to another persons account. They will not give you information on who the recipients are and when i attempted to email them several times they would ignore me and not answer my questions on where the money came from. They've asked to return the money I accepted for the money transfer before they started to ask me to do things to say, questionably legal things with it. DO NOT ACCEPT THIS POSITION. I was lucky enough to see what they were doing ahead of time before allowing them to use my personal information to illegally move money around from country to country it seems. This company is completely fake.
I was offered a service that consisted in employment services in order to land a job in the mining industry..  In my opinion the company(Mining Canada) shocked me by misleading me to believe they would help me land a job in the mining industry, as their website mentions that is their purpose. Under no circumstances and during the course of the correspondence with them did this objective was achieved..    And since I paid the sum of $ 159 for the delivery of the service, which I didn't receive to my full satisfaction. 
The person received a letter from the company saying they had been shortlisted for an administrative position and was asked to do an online interview via Intervue.ca  where the applicant video tapes themselves answering some questions. The company was opening a new outlet in Edmonton and Toronto. All this time, the company never called the applicant. Then, a week later, the company sent a letter stating the applicant had been chosen for the position and asked for full name and address and direct phone number so that they could send a check and a laptop to start work. The check is supposed to be for business and hotel booking arrangements for the managers of the office opening day. After further research, the applicant found out that the company website had only been registered in less than a month even though the company claims to have been established for more than 10 years. And the address doesn't match its postal code. When the applicant tried to look up the company on bbb.org  they were not listed at all. But eventually, the day after the applicant wrote to the site manager requesting more information, the company suddenly appeared listed on bbb.org but without any accreditation or information at all. It was impossible to find any more information about this company or former employees or clients. To anybody who is contacted by this company, please be aware and do your own research before making any decisions.
I received a email claiming he is from         and want to recruit people to join a          program to earn money. I found it suspicious as the email address is not from         and the program seems too good to be true. Please investigate and confirm if this is an legitimate business.
I received an email stating that I applied for a job as Administrative Assistant and that they would like a webcam interview which I said no to.  Then I received an email asking me to answer some general employment questions (no personal information was requested) and this morning I received an email stating that I had been selected from 180 candidates as the person they wanted for the position.  They stated that I would start doing business with them from home until some of the MP's came to Calgary in early November and in the meantime I would be given tasks to complete including ordering stationary and meeting with the Property Manager about the office.  I can forward a copy of the email if you wish but when I tried to copy and paste in Word I got nowhere.
I had first applied online to an official looking site about possibly working as a mystery hunter.  I Had then received a phone call "interview" with a woman who sounded very professional, educated and asked usual job interview questions, they said they are a strictly American company, and highly rated.  I had then received a letter in the mail with a note enclosed, saying I had been approved to be a mystery writer.  I searched they company online and found nothing about a car and when I searched the address it showed me there company name and everything I could find made it seem legitimate to me.  The letter had 2 assignments that needed to be done after which I needed to add the attached service evaluation forms and all aspects of purchases to them and when completed to phone your "assignment coordinator" to verify completion.  Assignment 1 was to go to one of the following retailers: Target, Costco, HomeDepot, Sears or Best buy, and spend $100 on a product of my choice.  There were detailed instructions about what I should be checking for (i.e. service, services, products) as well as "Customer Service Evaluation Sheets" that had to be filled out. Assignment 2 was to Send $1865.00 through Western Union. They wrote that the reason the amount is so high is because they have been receiving complaints of people being insulted by employees when trying to send more than $1000, and being treated unprofessionally especially to people wanting to send money to other countries. They also wanted to know if they were asking for proper ID and following all protocol, they wanted me to write down what kind of ID they asked for, if they took notice, as well as my service.  I also had a form for that assignment that needed to be filed back.  The check sent in the mail was for $2396.23, It said that $400 of the charge is my service fee, $100 of it was to buy the products for assignment 1, $1865 plus $31.23 service charge was for the western union assignment. They said in the letter that I needed to deposit the check in my own account to verify that it is me.  The letter had a Rep ID# that it said I would be using on all assignments and that if I had any questions to call the provided number.  It turns out it was all a game and the case never cleared, because I only spend the $100 on the product assignment but I got stuck with the $48 NFS fee.  I was waiting for the cloud to clear completely before doing the Western Union transfer, but I found out that what they wanted was for me to send the money before the wheels bounced.  In our world losing the $150 made a huge difference                                               Here is the info they gave me about there company:  (they used a real company name and address for the name) Northern Reflections at 21 Four Seasons Place (2nd floor) Marie, Ontario  :. Text: 1-306-415-0091 Call: 1-646-666-4496 Where they wanted the Western Union transfer sent: Name: James Perez Location: Mexico City, Mexico Please let me know if you would like me to call, mail or email the letter they sent me. Hopefully you can warn others about this soon, Thank you
Was approached with a job offer as a personal assistant by Williams Jardin who mentioned seeing my resume on indeed.ca. The job was to assist an international consultant  with shopping and payment of bills. He was to provide his personal UPS account number for sending the items and would provide the funds to cover them. Requested information such as name, email address, phone number, age, present job, and photo ID.  He Was unwilling to provide more information on his business when asked.
Received a job offer via email from Imtech Group even though I have never spoken with anyone from this company.  They asked that I provide them copy of my passport or ID.
I responded to a email posting on September 29,2015 and was offered a job at a minimum wage of $17/hour writing, typing, filing etc only to be told that I had to pay a software program fee of $19 up front. And all work was online which didn't correspond with the original job description of working at their office.
 The following is what I received after responding to an ad to work from home and it is similar to the one reported from Calgary but under a different company, but the email contents are very similar: Your recent application for Assistant Clerk has been approved by the Personnel Department. Your abilities appear suitable to the needs ImTech Group and we offer you a position.    Email from:  Joseph Pooley, Sales Manager ImTech Gmbh  (joseph.pooley@imtechgmbh.com) Dear "r., Please see the "Job Description" file for more details about current position.

Tel: +1 604 200 3319     NOTE:  As you can see, the email is computer generated and the address is not a physical address or proper Postal Code.  Along with the email above came a request that I provide my "personal government documentation --- like driver's license or passport".   I did some computer research on the company and I received a response to this email and I have yet to receive responses from my requests by email for further details about the company before getting any further information about myself.  However, they have my resume with my personal information and this concerns me as I don't want to have my identity stolen.  This job was posted on "indeed jobs" and thus, I thought it was cute.  I guess they don't check the companies posting job ads on their site. The following is their website - contact us area   https://imtechgmbh.com/?p=contact-us
