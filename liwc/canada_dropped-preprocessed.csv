This is the website: https://atlaspays.com/ As far as I knew at first the job was completely online and didn't really have any concerns. We exchanged a variety of emails (via c.berger@atlaspays.com) regarding contracts and personal information. I can provide details with specifics of the documents if necessary. I gave them information that is usually expected to be offered up when getting a new job. (aka address, full name, driver's license images, etc.) After a couple of days, she (who aliases herself as Christine Berger) replies congratulating me on my acceptance of the position of Customer Service Manager and that by signing the following document and sending my payment information I would be a confirmed employee (calling me from 44 20 8638 6979). So I open up the form to input my direct deposit information, and I find something a bit skeptical. They had asked me for  Bank Daily Withdrawal Limit  and  ATM Daily Withdrawal Limit , as well as the name of my bitcoin exchanger, trade platform, etc on the form. This made me very skeptical, as I had received employment scams before, and this seemed similar. I did some research on the website and found that there ""SETIGO Security"" tag: (https://secure.sectigo.com/ttb searcher/trustlogo?v querytype=W amp v shortname=CL1 amp v search=https://atlaspays.com/ amp x=6 amp y=5) was most likely fake and most likely bought from this site: https://www.ssls.com/brand/sectigo-ssl-certificates?gclid=Cj0KCQjwjPaCBhDkARIsAISZN7RtkEl2d jeqcm59gzkfDJdfDAZsrYT4YNu1cRyO7sR2TSfq-BFPc8aAvNREALw wcB Also, any address listed on the website did not correspond to any specific location/office (might possibly be because they are a startup, not sure I've been to legitimate offices for Telus which looked very sketchy), but rather a virtual office space. The scammer has ceased contact with me when asked about details regarding ATM/Bank daily withdrawal limit reasons. I learned that the scammer was most likely trying to get me to receive fake cheques and stolen cc payments, and sending them to the scammer via crypto or cash from an ATM.","{'la': 49.205944, 'lo': -122.82362, 'rlo': -2.143676568218358, 'rla': 0.8588057343519481}",0.0

M4Y 1G6,"Nov 30, 2020",Duden Furnitures,"On November 5, 2020, I applied for the position of Administrative Assistant at a company by the name of Duden Furnitures based out of Germany. I initially found their job posting on LinkedIn.com, and was redirected to ZipRecruiter.com, another job listing site, where I forwarded my resume to them. On November 6, I was contacted by ""Karry Steinier, Head of HR Department (hr@duden.ca)"" asking if I was still interested in the position. On November 9 at 9 AM, I received an email from ZipRecruiter that the job posting has been closed. I hadn rsquo t responded to the previous email yet and decided to follow-up with them to see if the position was already filled, saying that I am still very much interested. On the following day on November 10, I was forwarded a job offer to sign before the interview. This seemed out of the ordinary but the email said the signature is a formality before the interview so I read the job offer, which seemed legit, and sent the signed copy back to them on November 12. I heard back from them the same day and was told that I will be contacted by their manager for an interview. On November 16 around 1 PM, I received a call from a number from Edmonton, Alberta (7809132852). When I picked up, a man called ""Billy"" from Duden Furnitures wanted to have an interview with me. I thought it was odd that they didn't schedule a time with me prior to the actual interview but proceeded with it. We talked for about 20 minutes and he said that he would be in touch with me shortly in regards to the application. Almost 2 weeks later on November 27, I received an email from  ldquo Karry rdquo  again saying that my application has been approved. The email contained an Employment Agreement Form and a TD1 Form that they asked to sign and return, along with a copy of my photo ID. I was ecstatic that I got the job, got overly excited and returned the signed forms along with a copy of my Ontario Photo ID on November 28. The email didn rsquo t have the Job Offer Letter attached to it, and I only thought of re-reading it after sending back the forms. That rsquo s when I realized that a part of the letter seemed shady where it said  ldquo Your company will present you with a debit card for payment operations (5-7 working days). During the probation period, you will be able to receive money in your bank account from our accountant rdquo . It seemed strange that my personal bank account was to be involved in company transactions, and I forwarded the job offer to a friend of mine who is a recruiter. He helped me look into the matter and did some research to figure out that this is a scam. On their homepage (www.duden.ca), the links to Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest did not work nor the phone number listed on the website. All the job postings on multiple employment websites had disappeared as well. That rsquo s when I realized I had given out my personal information  ndash  SIN number on the TD1 Form and the information on my Photo ID  ndash  to a scammer. At 10 AM on November 30, I received another email from  ldquo Karry rdquo  congratulating me for joining their team. It said that my direct head is Purchasing Manager  ldquo Hailey Errington (purchase@duden.ca) rdquo  and to contact her to let her know when I can get started and that she will give me all the necessary documents for work. I have not responded to the last email and called the police to see if I can file a report but was told that can only happen if monetary loss has occurred, and was advised to avoid further contact with them. While I haven't lost any money as I didn't actually start working for them, and although it looks like their ulterior motive was to use me for their fake cheque scam rather than steal my personal information, I rsquo m concerned it may be misused now that they have access to it. Furthermore, looking through the emails again, I noticed there was another name  ldquo Voss Moebel rdquo  written next to Karry Steinier rsquo s name, which could only be found in the very first email she sent. I found out that there is an identical website under that name (www.vmoebel.ca) claiming to be a German business with offices in Canada (Quebec) as well as in the US (Nevada). Voss Moebel should be investigated alongside Duden.","{'la': 43.665959, 'lo': -79.38184, 'rlo': -1.385474474291335, 'rla': 0.7621147555908501}",0.0

V6T 1Z4,"Nov 05, 2020",Tiny Hugs,"This company was listed on the website Zip Recruiter looking to hire nannies in North Vancouver, Coquitlam, Vancouver, and Toronto. I applied as I already work in childcare and was looking for another childcare position. The morning after my application they called me for a phone interview from a Toronto number. I spoke to a woman, she told me she was calling for a pre-screening interview and asked about my childcare experience, where I was born,  my age, and if I was a student. She also asked if I had a criminal record check, I told her mine was over a year old so I would need a new one. She said I could get a new one for the final in-person interview and that she would email me to set up that interview. Minutes later I received an email with a different phone number than the one I was just called by even though the caller had said she would be emailing me. The email said that I was hired and would have a profile put on the website shortly. The email also said the company was BBB accredited and had a company address 538 W 24th street, Vancouver, BC M5R 1B9. I thought it was very strange they would hire me this quickly as I have been hired for this type of position before and when you work with kids you need to be thoroughly vetted. I looked up their business on the BBB and saw that they were not accredited. They also had a separate business address listed 2417 89 Nelson St  Vancouver, BC V6Z 0E7. I went to their website tinyhugs.net (the same website that their hiring email used) and saw a third company address listed 70 Yorkville Ave., Block #2, Toronto, ONT, M5R 1B9, Email: nanny@tinyhugs.net with a third phone number for their office different than the fourth phone number on the BBB website. I went to their Facebook page which has forty-odd reviews all written between August and September, all of the reviewers had accounts from random cities in the states, all with less than fifty (some even had zero) friends. All the reviews had weird English as if they were written by bots and there were no posts for the month of October. The Tiny Hugs BBB profile was created in September as was the document they sent me regarding my nanny contractor terms yet most of the views were written a month before this before they appeared to even be a company. On their website, there were only six women listed as nannies. A google image search of the photos of these women all traced back to stock photos most from the same stock photo site. My friend phoned the phone number listed on the site and a woman answered and said that she was no longer a nanny for the service but could pass her information on to some girls she knows she'd love. This number was supposed to be to the Tiny Hugs matching service that would give families the profile of three nannies that they could have phone interviews with. Today November 3, 2020, one day after I received the phone interview I was offered a position for an Avanish family in North Vancouver who wanted an Indian live-out Nanny to care for their ten-month-old five days a week. This email was from the same email account with a different address and a fifth phone number 538 W 24th street, Vancouver, BC M5R 1B9 Canada. I looked up this last name in North Vancouver's Yellow Pages and found a man who has no children that clearly would not be looking for a nanny. During my phone interview, I said I wanted a few hours as I was a student and that I couldn't start until next month and had never worked with children under two. Yet they gave me the listing for a position starting soon with an age group I had never worked with and far more hours than I requested. Address break down: The address on the website is for a vacant storefront in Toronto currently available for lease. The address on the BBB is for a unit in the apartment building 'The Arc' in Vancouver. The address in the email they sent me is for an empty lot in Vancouver. Conclusion: None of the three office addresses are currently owned by Tiny Hugs.","{'la': 49.261045, 'lo': -123.248794, 'rlo': -2.151097254412232, 'rla': 0.85976742822309}",0.0

These transactions were to be done using my personal bank account for ""training purposes"", and after that a corporate account would allegedly be provided to me. The premise was that clients of the company cannot pay the company directly - for a reason the contact was unable to explain to me - so they deposit funds in my account, and then I send to payment on to the company, less my 7% commission.

I then contacted her via text  amp  said i had the money. Next day she was really trying to get a hold of me  amp  I said I was out running my own errands in public transit. She said I was putting me  amp  her at risk because I had company funds  amp  threatened to call the police. As i wasn't taking any calls she decided to use the Edmonton none emergency police line by spoofing it. I also did not pick that up. I then called the number back  amp  it was actually the police number  amp  the officer said scammers spoof any number  amp  no one had called me from their station. And because of covid  amp  the lack of a personal vehicle, I was supposed to take an uber which they would reimburse for the week at $150. As for the pay, it would be $300 per errand. I was then instructed to make sure my phone was fully charged  amp  I was available on the app called ""whatsapp"" where her ""assistant"" Holly would send me instructions for the errands. So, Holly sent me an address which was at the waves coffee shop by the Palliser. I then pretended I was there  amp  called Clancy. She then started asking what machines I could see in the shop. In the meantime, Holly was supposed to send me a barcode which she did but I missed it bcz I was on the phone with Clancy. So, I asked Clancy what I was going to do, she said we would be paying a bill. So, this bill was being paid by the bitcoin machine in Palliser. At that point I lost my cool  amp  started to curse her out  amp  she hang up because she knew they had been busted. Holly quickly blocked me from whatsapp not before me telling her they were good but not the best. Clancy's number: +12269612097 Holly's number: +15196942776 Please put this story out in the public so that everyone knows there's a bunch of women scammers trying to put people in more debt.

At the end of the apprenticeship, I was assured full time employment.  At the very conclusion of my apprenticeship, my employer fired me without compensation or any of the original $ back, and most importantly, unjustly with discriminatory intent (she said my lifelong battle with mild mental illness was a weakness and that I wasn't welcome at the store until I was cured). This in itself seemed a cut and dry case of discrimination with the Alberta labor standards and Human Rights, however, due to the fact that she never technically 'employed' me, there's very little the ALS could do for compensation of a wasted 6 months of income, plus the assurance of subsequent income as an artist in her shop.  I am currently trying to resolve this issue with AHR, however, they are having problems locating the company, because it seems the business is no longer registered.  So while my initial intent was to simply try to recoup my losses, however, with information I gleaned while working there - nothing but cash transactions with clients and payment to staff.

I responded to the e-mail asking more anout the job and got a fast reply with most of the same information from the first e-mail restated, as well as a link to an employment agreement. The agreement was via HelloSign and looked less professional.It did not ask me for my social security number or banking information but did ask for my exact address and an electronic signature. It did include a business number: 867603623 which I looked up and it belonged to a Norstan Canada Company, however, it is based out of Winnipeg MB, not North York as it stated in both e-mails and I believe that it is a flooring company not an IT company like the website and job description in the email stated. I then went back to the Website and called all of the numbers provided including sales inquiries and tech support to which there was no answer or automated service.The company is also not registered under the BBB website which leads me to believe that it is not a legitimate company and that this is a scam to obtain my SIN number and banking information. It is a shame if it is fake because It would have been my families saving grace. But things that fall into your lap and sound far too good to be true, usually are.","{'la': 42.530842, 'lo': -81.658299, 'rlo': -1.425206179127993, 'rla': 0.7423032265454901}",0.0

I was told that the money I make is mine, but then when I found out via a phone call that the models only take home 20% of what they are supposed to make and the company takes 80% - that's highway robbery! Next I find out that I haven't gotten paid! I understand that they would take a cut, but not 80%! This is also NOT written on the website of the platform that they use to stream! All it says on the website is that the models / performers get a part of the amount, but NOT 20% ONLY.... Next to find out the 80% goes to OTHER models who make the top 5..... so they are using my money to buy gifts and trips to other models.... not fair..... I didn't work for free and all of the other models are getting paid, so I need my money! As per what I'm told I'm supposed to get is $434.25 US (this is my 20%), but what I actually want is my full amount that I worked those hours for, which in total comes out to $1,789.32! Not to mention the leg work to get my money, because I haven't yet received any payment from them - so my settlement that I want form them at Paradise Kitty is $2500.00 US for all of this trouble. I only worked on this site to get extra money to help pay off my debts, but if I had known in advance that they take 80%, I wouldn't have applied to be a model on this site! I found out 2 weeks later (after the date that I started) that the models only get 20% of the pay! Another thing that I was told is that I could apply for direct deposit, but that's not the case - I was informed then about a wire transfer and that was supposed to happen on Saturday, and it hasn't! So, in lieu to this, I am asking for the full payment in the form of a check of $2500.00 USD so that I can get everything back that I earned! I will never bother them again after this. The person in contact is Tommy Gibbs - the second number is his cell phone number, and he says that this is his company. I want my money that's owed to me so that I can finish paying what I need to pay. Do NOT go with this site - they are not honest!

I proceeded with the application as usual. All communication was conducted through email only. They are really adamant only having contact through email only. As the application proceeded I found a few things to be out of the ordinary. I immediately noticed the website was a fake especially with the photos of their personnel. I even know the website they used to obtain  photos of their so-called employees. I called the phone number provided on the application and it would go dead, not even an answering machine. I even called during their stated business hours which is 9-5 and still the line went dead.

N6H 5X4,"May 05, 2020",Koncam Consulting,"Fake employment offer. I never contacted this company while job searching and was contacted by the 1st email. I responded without details to get the job description and received the 2nd email which contained the job offer. I was skeptical due to the poor grammar, vague and confusing job detail, the mentioning of a bank account in the job description, and the offer without an interview. With these red flags I looked up website and could not find it on google search alone. The website from the link in the email looks professional, but again details of a business would be confusing for a client to contact them. From LinkedIn, I found the one director which seems legit, but with a Toronto address. I looked up the company location and could not find the company registered to that building with office space for rent. From the registration of the company with the gov't, it registers at an Oakville address. When I looked up the name Tammy Faulkner from Barrie, ON, I found the BBB listed scam. The name was used with Eventis Management Consulting offering a similar employment scam with the address from Barrie being the same despite the very many years claimed to have worked for Koncam. This was the end of my research on this particular scam and I did not waste any more time on this topic, other then to advise BBB. I did not attempt to make any further contact for risk of giving away any personnel information.

This professed business owner brought me here to what I believed was a career opportunity of a lifetime. I have been hugely misled and conned. This person is trying to promote this Seattle-based business here in Saudi Arabia  amp  hoping to expand to other countries in the Middle East. After my unpleasant dealings with him all of March here, I have discovered that this person is a con-artist. I have seen lie after lie about any business or any proofs of the services it provides. Most of all, I have heard directly from his mouth lie after lie. This is a dangerous manipulative man who after confronting him numerous times here, became angry, insulted me and slandered me, and on top of everything else, abandoned his responsibility as sponsor during this COVID crisis. He bailed out of trying to further accommodate me or help me return home to Canada before the travel ban went up here in Saudi Arabia. I have notified the other parties (educational professionals  amp  universities) here in Saudi Arabia with whom we met and whom this Mr. Umal Ahmed (not his real name) has lied to. I bring forth great concern about a manipulative dangerous lying professed education consultant with a business called Macademics based in Seattle, Washington, USA.

This person had emotionally toyed with me all of March and now am stranded here. Then during the onset of COVID, jeopardized my safety by trying to remove me from the hotel he was paying for me to stay at and when I refused to have anything to do with him or go anywhere with him he abandoned me. Now I am left in another country during the coronavirus pandemic and stuck with the cost of all things. I was forced to contact the Canadian Embassy immediately. I am safe now from this man but it did not come without severe mental anguish. Mr. Umal Ahmed is not his real name and his professed business Macademics is not really in existence as he is claiming with many of us around the world. This person and business is highly suspicious.","{'la': 51.06719, 'lo': -114.082262, 'rlo': -1.991111090022811, 'rla': 0.891290605241523}",0.0

N5W 0A6,"Apr 14, 2020",Global Education Community ,"I was sent an email outlining a position as an ""Administrative Assistant"" for Global Education Community (details attached) The position started at $25/hr and then went to $30/hr after 30 days of probation. I was a little skeptical about the pay but I thought I would continue with the role as a work at home position was ideal for with the whole COVID-19 pandemic going on. I was sent the paperwork and registration after the manager ""Serena C  "" asked me a few questions about the position a day/two later. The questions were informal just asking about my availability and being able to work from home until the supposed ""office"" opens in London Ontario by the end of April. 2-3 days later I was sent my assignment which was to create a PowerPoint 25-30 slides outlining my city or province to impress and entice their ""students"" to visit Canada. I was given 3 days to complete the assignment and was asked to work the typical 9-5. I thought that was more than enough time for me to complete this presentation as it was a pretty light set of expectations, but maybe that's just me. After completing the assignment I was later sent the second assignment send about 2 hours later with an even lighter workload and about a week to complete. It was to research cheap hostels or hotels and record about 25 of them including accommodations, price, facilities, etc. The research was to be used for newly arriving international students who haven't been assigned campus housing. Before I began the second assigned I thought I'd do some further digging into the company's website. I discovered that one of their so-called partners ""Air Canada"" was not listed as being their partner on their website.

Initially I was approached by this agent VISHAL PATEL assuring me of making passive income by becoming an insurance broker and selling insurance policies to people and he told me that I need to recommend this business opportunity to my friends and family members and bring in 3 referrals within 1 month and have a chance of winning $750 and a free Vegas trip to attend the WFG convention. It was clearly stated by the agent that WFG is not a multi level marketing company and then I was enrolled in the company by paying joining fee of  $141.25 CAD and Vegas convention registration fee of  $185.00 USD. I was called on to attend the weekly meetings and then later was told by the agent that I need to talk to my friends and family about this opportunity and tell them that this is doing wonders for me . I was also told to provide 10 phone numbers of people whom I know as referrals.I was not happy lying to my friends and family and misguiding them by telling them that I am doing very well in this business and making a fortune out of it .Then the agent VISHAL PATEL called me over the phone and told me that in order to succeed in this business I have to lie to people and tell them that this business is working wonders for me. The next surprise was when I was called for a meeting on the pretext that I will be given some training and education as the company requires every employee to have a Life License Qualification license (LLQP) and WFG helps each employee get this license. And when I had the meeting with the SMD - Senior Marketing Director of the company RAJEEV BHATIA, I was asked to buy the insurance policies from him. This came as a big shocker to me and I was very disappointed when I realized that I myself need to buy the insurance products of the company which was hidden from me right from the start. I was never informed initially that I have to buy the policies myself . I refused to buy any policy as I didn't need it and so the SMD asked me NOT come to this company anymore. I left the company and then made calls to the agent VISHAL PATEL. Unfortunately he kept rejecting my calls and kept sending me messages that he is busy and that he will call back. Till date he has never called back. Also in the AMA agreement documents of the company my signature is false. I would request the authorities to investigate into this matter and I need the full refund of the registration fee and convention fee and damages for representing my  false signatures . I also saw RAJEEV BHATIA recording my credit card details in the meeting and when I questioned he said it is the company policy. Do companies like WFG have the legal right to record customers credit card details including CVV # and expiry date?","{'la': 43.768102999999996, 'lo': -79.496576, 'rlo': -1.387476995261903, 'rla': 0.763897504702007}",503.0

I corresponded a bit with the person to gather more information and did some research to see if in fact it was real or a scam. - Two emails from them had poor spelling and many grammar mistakes. - I have inspected their website and have called the number on the site, 902-400-1339, a voice msg says ""you have reached a text mail subscriber""  and the mobile # that texted me, 807-788-2400, has a recorded msg saying ""this number does not accept phone calls"". - The company name on the job posting doesn't match the business name that I corresponded with nor the website name. - I Google mapped the address in Halifax shown on the website and also Google mapped their address in New York and became more suspicious (check it out - 5162 Duke St Halifax, NS and 630 Fifth Avenue,New York, NY). - This website looks VERY similar to one in Singapore: http://drivensg.com/ - i do not know if this one is a scam or if they just copied the site. - This was supposed to be for a professional driver position and not once did the individual ask for my driver's abstract. - They haven't asked for any personal banking information yet but I would expect that would be their next step as that wish to pay me $2,885 up front!! - There are names and pictures of 4 people on the website - none of which have a Facebook or LinkedIn account.  The business also has neither. I don't know how many other red flags there needs to be in order to realize this is not on the up-and-up.

It looked cool, so I wen for it on Friday Feb 14th at 1:30pm at   ldquo 3250 Bloor St West Suite #600 East Tower -Toronto rdquo . I did not know until I reached there it was an agency so I felt little weird because they asked me to fill a form, which I did but I was little uncomfortable with it. Then Peter James, took me to his office, he asked for my availability, I said that I work on campus already and full time student and hence I cannot work more than 20h off campus, I actually didn't go for a job, but I fell for it. Then he signed me up on a website called  oneclicktalent.net where he created my account with basic info such as address, DOB, height, weight etc.  Then he clicked my photo with his phone and uploaded, that was another skeptical point, he said only he can upload photo. He had the login and password for the account that he created for me, which is basically a job posting kind of website. He told me this website had monthly fee of $14 something and he kind of rushed through it and didn't explain me much about the policies. Then he asked me to pay him $100 upfront, which I did through e-transfer to his email ""bighousetalentsix@gmail.com"". He said they are shooting at York University tomorrow and if I am available, I said yes I am available, so he wrote my name. Then I left the office and on the subway, I checked the email from ""oneclicktalent"" about the agreements which said that I cannot opt out from before 8-months and I had to pay monthly fee which they deduct through my bank account as I gave them my DDF (Direct Deposit Form). When I read it was 8-month long and I didn't have the option to opt out, I ran back to his office, but he had left by the time I reached, then I called him and I said I no longer want to be a part of this, he said to call him tomorrow since he is busy. I kept reading online, and through reddit I came across a post which somebody had shared and had gone through exact same thing, and that was very shocking to me and I started worrying about it. So I called TD Bank around 10pm and told them about the situation since I wasn't feeling good about it, they verified the ""One Click Talent"" said it's not verified through BBB and hence it's a red flag. They told me to cancel my account to be safe which I did and I opened a new checking account to keep my money safe at the TD branch on Steels by York University. In the morning of Feb 15th, 2020 I called ""One Click Talent"" at +1 877 228 8026, and I told them to cancel the subscription, they said they cannot do that since the agent had signed me up for 8-month, which is weird for them to know as I didn't tell them my name on the call. They said I had to contact my agent ""peter"" and they couldn't do anything, and I had to send them a letter to cancel, and only then they can cancel after 8 months. I felt really worried, so I also informed the police about this as I didn't want to get into any risk in the future. I called back ""Peter James"" around noon on Feb 15th, 2020 and informed that I want to quit this and he got angry at me on the phone and shouted, and I felt really uncomfortable on the call, and when I asked for refund of $100 he cut the phone. At this moment, my account is safe and money as well. I took the necessary steps based on what my TD bank told me to stay safe, but I am worried since they cannot take money from my account and they denied to cancel my account on ""One Click Talent"", they might claim in future the money as a collection. I didn't sign any agreement physically on any paper nor did I sign any contract, but I am worried as I don't want to end up in any illegal scenario in the future. Hence I am informing BBB about it.

The confusing part is my parents are not selling this product (or any actual product) to people they are simply recruiting people and pretending like the online marketing business is so successful and that they're making a lot of money at it when they are not. So my parents are paying money (thousands and thousands of dollars by now) to advertise this ""online marketing business"" on          to get people recruited. My parents only make money when someone buys the machine for $5000 (I'm pretty sure they only make $100 off of that recruitment) and then those people start their own business of recruiting other people to do the same thing. The problem is my parents have not made any money. They've spent thousands of dollars advertising this on          trying to get recruitment's, and however much they paid to buy the machine to begin with (they're likely well over $10,000 into this business with no sign of giving up. There are groups on          with other people who are so-called ""successful"" at this but they are clearly doing what my parents were taught to do via the company instructors which is ""act and look like your making tons of money and have freedom to work when you want and where ever you want"". They are taught by the people higher up in the business to ""act successful"" and ""pretend like they're making lots of money"" to make it look appealing to other potential recruitment (or victims as I feel they may be). There is a complex pyramid of commissions they make per recruitment and once they reach a certain number of recruitment's they go up in the tier and then make a slightly higher commission on the other people's recruitment's below them. They are taught to comment on other recruiter's ""business""          pages  amp  ads to say how this business is working for them and they no longer have to work and they have this crazy lifestyle etc when none of that is true. I would like to note that my parents are not intentionally scamming people, they are victim of the scam. I do not intend on getting them in trouble but I want to look out for their well-being. I am shocked that they were actually naive enough to get involved in this to begin with. They believe this is a legit business they are in no way trying to hurt other people by doing this as they are victims of the false promise to make lots of money by recruiting people. This is the        page that sells the        water filter systems (which I have no idea what it has to do with them getting people to ""start an online marketing business"" other than I feel like its a cover up to make the business seem legitimate). They also don't seem to mention ANYTHING regarding the online marketing business on the        website nor do they mention anything about the Water Filtration system when people are talking about the Online Marketing Business but once they hook you into their online seminar they tell you that it is required for you to buy this water system in order to start your online marketing business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         nbsp My understanding is that these people are recruiting people by selling the idea of making lots of money and so much freedom. The recruitment people watch a seminar and are instructed to pay $99 to start the business and then they are told they must buy this water filtration system in order to start being eligible to start their online marketing business. Then once they've bought that then they start the recruitment process over again looking for other recruitment's. I recommend investigating and getting an officer to follow the procedure as if they were interested int his business to find out how it actually works.","{'la': 42.979548, 'lo': -81.242074, 'rlo': -1.417941682448879, 'rla': 0.750134623618943}",10000.0

N5Z 3C4,"Nov 06, 2019",Aramark Canada Ltd. Spoof / Imposter,"Was contacted by a Sr. Human Resources Manager at Aramark Canada Ltd. through indeed.com offering me a job for Customer Service Associate (CSA) position in which i would be working from home. So the first thing that was asked of me,was to fill out an Application for employment in which i filled out. The second thing i was asked to do was to fill out an Employment agreement. Then i was contacted and told my application was under review and i would be contacted in 1-2 business days. After 2 business days i was contacted and informed that i was hired for the Customer Service Associate (CSA) position but i need to fill out a Online Interac E ndash Transfer details.(Because i would be working with bitcoin and buying software for customers,so this company would be depositing money into my bank account) So after all forms were filled out,i begin my first day of training.I was told to wait with my email account open because i was going to get sent my first task. Finally after waiting a half hour,i was told to create a Skype account in which this Sr. Human Resources Manager told me that she can recieve my messages faster.(Already had a skype account so it was just easy to add them) Then i was given another set of instructions below: ""The essence of the first tasks is that our finance department will send corporate money to your bank account through e-Transfer Interac. Then you need cash out money in the bank branch after that replenish your personal Bitcoin wallet in Bitcoin ATM. The money comes from our customers who are ready to buy our software. These clients will need to explain all the details of our program later. I will teach you how to do it later. As I told you before, you should fill up your Bitcoin wallet, to start accepting orders from our customers and perform large deals with our partners. How the process of filling your wallet should be done: 1. Receive corporate money with Interac e-transfer, deposit money into your bank account. 2. Cash out money from bank branch. 3. Replenish your Bitcoin wallet in the Bitcoin ATM. Put money into BTM machine. 4. Then take a photo of BTM screen with Bitcoins amount, which will add on your wallet. 5. Send this photo to me as your report. The following instructions and your next tasks will be after the first tasks. I will also send the instructions gradually for you. We created your personal bitcoin wallet in our company already. I attached your personal Bitcoin wallet to this message. It is a picture (QR CODE). Save it on your mobile phone and take with you when you go to the BTM. This code will help you to deposit money into your Bitcoin wallet. This is personal qr code of your wallet, only you have access to this. DO NOT LOSE IT! DO NOT GIVE IT TO OTHER HANDS! ! Please confirm that you understand the process of filling your wallet. ! Please confirm that you saved your QR code. I am waiting for your reply."" So i replied back and immediately got another email to send my current postal code. And I will be sent the address Bitcoin ATM and video instructions: how to use the qr code with BTM. So i replied back with my postal code and after 23 minutes i get this reply ""I just received a notification. This position was taken by another candidate. The position is closed. Thank you."" Now, to make things perfectly clear,i did everything that was asked of me,adding this person on Skype and sending my postal code,it didn't take me more then 5 minutes plus all the forms they asked me to sign the beginning. What company goes through all the trouble to hire someone then on the first day of training and within less then an hour say that the position was taken by another candiate.? Why was i even hired in the first place?

One day I received an email from a ""prospective employer"" by the name of Mia Castro from Experrior.com.  Initially, it seemed legitimate and then things started to get strange. They asked some questions based on my experience which I answered.  I got a call from Mia from the number listed on the website which is +1(587)404-0441.  I tried to call it back and it would immediately hang up without ringing.  I tried from my friends phone, same thing.  At first I didn't think too much of it as it could just be technical difficulties, but when I tried again a few days later and it still was happening, I questioned Mia why I couldn't get through. She said it was really busy and the switchboard must be overwhelmed.  That didn't sound right either. So I questioned her again and said that it was not professional to have a number that a customer couldn't get through for such an extended period of time.  She still tried to rationalize it and said that I didn't need to contact anyone at that number as I already was communicating with her ""my manager"" via         .

Finally they wanted banking info so they could process transactions during the probationary time. This I had a hard time with because so many of the larger companies can do deposit only accounts.

T6E 5S7,"Oct 17, 2019",Experrior Logistics ,"Beware!! 110%SCAM. I'm college educated, I pride myself on my integrity and knowledge, and I even got scammed. This was ELABORATE!! They contact you as per your resume that they found on LinkedIn and Ziprecruiter. Even when I was skeptical, they had all the answers. I conversed with them by phone and email 22 times over a 6 day period before accepting the position. When you research the company, it shows in business since 1969. They had the government documents proving they paid taxes  they have a website, there are no spelling errors when email correspondence was sent back n' forth, and they had permanent HQ address. I had to complete testing before hiring, I had an initial phone interview where you could hear people working in the background followed by an in person interview, they answered all my questions, and I even had tax forms, a contract, and direct deposit. Like the checks scam, this one operates through etransfers, wire transfers, paypal, and credit card. I was hired as a payment manager responsible for invoicing the customer, collecting, taking payments, and accounting procedures in regards to logistics. In the past, I have done all these tasks as well, I have a background in management, logistics, administration, and accounting, so the specified duties raised no flags. Then they sent me their customers first payment...then I began to worry. 1) You are obviously expected to use your own bank account? 2) Payment was sent via etransfer to me directly 3) I was sent on a bank run to cash this payment and then redirected to, get this...a convenience store lol I was told to insert the cash into this machine which is used to complete transfers to the business account. This machine was a bitcoin machine. I've heard a lot about bitcoin and got very insecure...I immediately contacted my bank in which they pointed out the funds transfer was fraudulent and to contact the police. I did everything by the book, contacted who I had to, I have all my email correspondence, pictures, as well the receipts. Hours after this happened the ""So called"" company sent another payment. I deleted my communication app (telegram messenger), and ignored all phone calls. This morning, I received an email that mia castro was undeliverable, meaning they ALREADY deleted all the accounts, the website is gone, the phone number is inactive, and they are a ghost. In calling the police, I thought they would take this threat seriously especially because I had every bit of evidence, they said they would send a car, I've called twice, am still waiting. Granted this is no murder, but they have ALL my personal information, and have disappeared after STEALING from whoever's money I transfered. Believe me, they dont care about catching these people, but with the scams becoming more and more sophisticated, and your resumes online, and with the continuous technological advancements in the world today, you are more likely to become a victim, it's clearly not hard. Be proactive, if it's too good to be true...IT IS!! Mine wasn't even too good to be true, including my wage, it seemed very realistic up until the point of no return. Protect yourselves, report to BBB to help others, and just be cautious, cause they are out there among you and I daily.","{'la': 53.470097, 'lo': -113.47806, 'rlo': -1.980565775775676, 'rla': 0.933229244010742}",2860.0

I had posted my resume everywhere I could in hopes of getting contacted about a better job opportunity than the one I was currently employed at. They took advantage of my desperation for a better job and told me ""congratulations, your resume has been selected, please install Google Hangouts and we will proceed with your interview"" It came out that they were trying to get a company base established in Winnipeg but to get started they were going to send me a cheque to purchase the office materials I would need in order to start working for them. I was in a bad place mentally so I did as they asked and deposited a cashier's cheque worth $5600 USD into my bank account and then sent them a copy of the deposit receipt as they had requested. They proceeded to tell me that they would only give me 1 direction at a time. As a current manager I understood this as if you start giving out too many directions at once, it can be confusing. They then asked me when the cheque cleared to pull the money out and deposit into the bank account of the ""vendor"" At the time this did sound fishy but since they sent me a cashier's check I didn't think it would matter much because in my experience, I assumed a cashier's cheque is like a money order meaning the money is there already. After pulling out the money and depositing it, that's where the issue started. I was told that they didn't give me enough money for the purchase and said they would be sending me another cheque. I received it a couple of days later and this time it was for $8900 USD. I didn't hear anything from my bank for the first one so I went and deposited this one too and sent them a copy of the deposit receipt once again. After a couple of days and trying to login into my online banking and being denied, I decided to call my bank head office. They informed me I would have to go into a bank branch to discuss it with the employees there. I went down to the bank and have never been more mortified in my entire life. When I started inquiring with my bank about what had transpired, they told me that the cashier's check bounced ($5600 USD) and that the second one deposited ($8900 USD) was not signed by the right person and was unauthorized ergo not going through. I asked what else we can do and now my bank is pursuing me for the $6900 I now owe them. I stayed in touch with the original person I spoke with and started asking questions. (fake company rep) I explained to them what happened with both the cheques and they denied it for the first 5 times I messaged them and then they agreed with me that they sent me fraudulent cheques and they wanted to remedy it because they really wanted me to work for them. They had told me originally that the money was sent to purchase a macbook air and all the software programs I would need. They informed me they had the laptop ready for me and sent me pictures of it. (after googling ""macbook air box opening"") I discovered pictures of ""my laptop"" posted on Google with the same couch, coffee table and desktop background on it. They told me to reach out to ""the vendor"" to ask them to give my money back to me as it is that person's fault and not mine. The ""vendor"" had called me at my work (I have no idea where they even got the phone number from) and said that I screwed him over and his bank closed his account because of the fraudulent activity. After contacting them repeatedly and telling them that I cannot afford their screwing with me and costing me this money that they need to remedy the situation. They sent me another cheque for $13,000 USD which I haven't deposited and I am now dealing with the police.","{'la': 49.908601, 'lo': -97.112235, 'rlo': -1.694928244720475, 'rla': 0.8710694125141341}",6900.0

Upon filling out their application for employment, I was given a phone interview with a woman who had a thick European Accent.  She said that I must use my personal account during the trial period for processing payments.  That was red flag no. 1.  Afterwards, when I spoke with Mike Burns through the telegram app which I was instructed to install, he told that me he required ID so I asked him ""what kind?""  He responded by requesting a photo of me holding my passport and a paper that says trafford freight systems inc handwritten. That was red flag no. 2.  Company was not listed on glassdoor, I called Service Canada, Ministry of Labour, Federal Labour Program and of course BBB. I did not send the passport information and asked why they would entrust their money in someone's personal account and he responded that it was just for ""the probationary period"".  I pressed him about the passport and he did not respond. He also asked for my driver's license. There are too many shady aspects of this company to warrant further communication or dealings.

I was unsure about the offer as it was too good to be true ie offering pay of 35USD/hour of work for either PT or FT. I decided to do some digging into the company and the first red flag was the unprofessional website that stood out. Secondly, the physical address doesn't exist on google maps, Collins didn't understand the concept of payroll and last but not least, it is not listed on BBB. I'm unsure of where this was leading to but I'm assuming they would have asked for my SIN number for payroll purposes.

T2C 3L7,"Aug 12, 2019",Crown Carlton Concierge,"On July 23/19 I was contacted by a man who called himself David, who represents a company called Crown Carlton Concierge (CCC).  He said my resume came across his desk for a customer service/personal assistant role.  He briefly explained that the role involved taking care of errands for executives and the wealthy such as picking up groceries, prescriptions, dry cleaning, paying bills and other such tasks.  I would be paid $200-$400 per assignment and could do up to eight assignments per week.  He further explained that if I were to successfully complete a three-day probationary period that I would be given an employee account and login to pick from a list of available tasks weekly, making my own schedule.  He explained that gas and other expenses would be paid for by the company and when I was officially hired, I would be paid by direct deposit.  He then asked if that would interest me, and I said yes. He told me I would receive direction from, communicate with and send photos of records to HR using WhatsApp.  He explained I would be getting more direction in a package he would be sending me on Thursday, July 26/19.  He welcomed me to the team, said it was good to have me on board, he looked forward to working with me and we briefly discussed dress attire.  The call ended there. On Thursday, July 26/19 I received a Purolator package that contained  A draft/draft customer copy from the National Bank of Canada in the amount of $7,787.23. A notice on CCC letter head with directions on how to confirm receipt of the draft, signed by Rachel Burk, Financial Co-ordinator for CCC.  The letter request that I call David Bradley to confirm receipt of the funds, warning a stop payment would be placed if I failed to contact him.  I called him and confirmed receipt.  He said I would be doing two assignments and would be paid a total of $400 for these assignments. He instructed me to go to the bank and to call him when I arrived for more direction.  I proceeded to the bank, called him on arrival and he then told me that the bank should not hold the draft as it was verified funds.  He advised that if any questions were asked to say it was for a personal settlement.  I was then instructed to withdraw $4750 and call him back after. I proceeded into my bank and spoke to a teller to deposit the draft.  She suggested that because I had enough money in my account for the withdrawal that I could deposit it without verification.  I insisted she call to verify as I was not interested in spending my own money.  She called the bank with me present and verified the draft.  After it was verified, I asked to withdraw $4750. I then called David as previously instructed, he advised that I would be contacted by Lisa in HR and I would be paying some bills.  He also asked to be called again when I arrived at the second location.  Lisa messaged me on WhatsApp.  She sent me a QR code to use for the bill payment and that David would walk me through it.  I called David when I arrived and he again told me I would be taking care of a bill payment, asked if I was familiar with Bitcoin and I said yes.  I then asked what kind of bills are being paid through Bitcoin?  He said that the client settles his donations in this way for non-profit organizations.  It was at this time I began to feel uncomfortable and suspicious but excused it, thinking my other assignments would legitimize the job. I proceeded with the process of purchasing and sending the Bitcoin using the QR code sent to me by Lisa and confirmed the completion of the task with a picture of the receipt to Lisa and another call to David, as requested.  I was then told by David I would receive more instructions from Lisa to purchase baby items.  Using WhatsApp, I was sent some pictures and a list of the items that I was to purchase, with amounts  ndash  to be donated to the Children rsquo s hospital.  I asked for direction on where to drop it/in who rsquo s name/to whom and was advised to donate it to the information desk in the name of that on the draft.   I then purchased the items, or the closest to what I was asked to buy by Lisa and proceeded to the hospital. I had received a message from Lisa advising of my next bill payment of $2080 and that she would be sending the next QR code. A lady named Sheri, representing another role in the company answered when I called David to confirm my arrival at the hospital. She sounded very professional and this rested some of my suspicions.  I confirmed that I was to donate this stuff from Jason (name on draft) and that the hospital would advise me on the process.  I proceeded to donate to the hospital and was asked to complete paperwork.  When I messaged Lisa for the info to complete the form she changed her advice and told me to just donate in my name.  I again started feeling suspicious but did as she directed. Upon returning to my vehicle I called David to discuss my concerns with the next assignment.  I explained to him that this draw would put me over my daily limit and I would need to talk to another teller.  I expressed to him that it was weird and he said he would call me back.  Sheri called me back from David rsquo s number and explained that she understands my concern but that this was the process, each assignment required a separate draw to avoid confusion.  She added that these are verified funds for a vehicle purchase and that I should not have to explain that to the bank but could if need be.  She directed I withdraw $2850. I proceeded to the bank and withdrew the $2850 as directed.  This was a bit of a process as the teller assisted me to arrange my account in order to withdraw the amount around my daily limit.  I proceeded to purchase and send $2080 of Bitcoin as per Lisa rsquo s previous message using the QR code she provided.  I then called David to confirm the assignment was complete and sent a picture of the receipt to Lisa as directed.  I was asked if I was available for more assignments the next day and I said yes.  After all these tasks were done, I was left with $825 and now on the hook for the full amount of the draft. It turns out that the draft was a counterfit and the phone number on the draft was changed to the scammer's number. When the teller called to verify the draft, they were actually speaking to the scammers. 4 days later I was notified by the bank (actuall days drafts take to verify funds) that the draft was a fake.","{'la': 50.976364, 'lo': -114.016617, 'rlo': -1.9899653686353391, 'rla': 0.889705392495106}",7787.23

T5A 3M3,"Jul 31, 2019",calgary international logistics Ldt.,"First I was desperate for a job so was enticed by a Nichole Fox, who contacted me via email with a job offer. She did not say where she got may name and information from, but I had put my resume and contact infor. on indeed and maybe linkled so thought it may have come from the one of the many jobs that I applied for. She  thought I might want to consider a job for an unnamed but great company, with full benefits a full time salary of 32.80 an hour and she named the position as paymaster manager. It was homebased so I could do all of it at home and it was entry level so they would train me. A sucker is born everyday so I did my due diligence to find out about the company, which had a nice website which was very reassuring. But I did not call their number, to verify their employees until later and the number was simply busy. In the meantime Nichole was very pushy about my signing preliminary papers. An application form which unfortunately I had to give my references, I gave out names and contact infor. to  professors from my school who I will now have to warn  as I unwittingly gave them the information they might use nefariously. What concerned me was that they were anxious to get my bank information and said that while on probation I would use my account to send them money from the companies that would send me their payments. And they would give me 3% for each transaction but reserved the right to reverse any money that may be overpaid. This did not sound right even for someone who knows little about how to cheat in the banking system. Also the phone interview which they were so anxious I receive was not at all like the pressure ones that I had encountered before. In fact, I could have said anything and it was okay. Oh, the woman interviewing me over the phone was filipino, while this was not a problem, she seemed more like a  telephone solicitor rather than a member of the company. Nothing seemed professional, even Nichole's correspondance was filled with typos. Also, everything is time sensitive and they are always making sure that you are still in there.

T3M 0P8,"Jul 25, 2019",Benz Freight Solutions Inc.,"This company contacted me via email, said they saw my resume online and that they thought I would be a good fit for a position in their company. They asked if I was interested, and with being in search of work I said Yes. They told me I would have to pass a phone interview (with someone who had a very strong French accent) which was basically someone asking me if I could work full or part time, if I had a car, and letting me know that I would not have access to the company bank accounts until after my probationary period. The job was for the position of 'Operations Manager - Inbound Operations'. They later went on to inform me that I was a good fit and that they thought I would make a great addition to their team. With that they sent me a letter of employment to sign and an official job application form to fill out (for their records). I noticed that I wasn't getting any government forms to fill out for tax purposes, they told me those types of forms get completed after I 'pass my probationary' period! It was after that when they started to inquire about my personal information, stuff that isn't normally required when being hired. They wanted to know about my banking knowledge, what kind of bank account I had (personal, business or both), if I was familiar with different types of wire transfers and if I had experience with credit cards (they wanted to know if I had credit cards available). When this information came about obviously some red flags went up... they were wanting me to start giving them some of my personal information so that they could either access or have me access this information in order to complete the work I would be doing for them (ie. they were wanting me to use my own for for the purposes of their business). I explained to them that I would not be using my own personal finances in any way and that this seemed like a scam. They went on to say that if I wasn't comfortable with doing that there were other ways for me to 'pass my probationary' period without having to use my own money. Next, they contacted me and said they had a client and that I was to go onto https://www.goldmoney.com/ and set up an account and once I had that completed I was to contact them. During setting up the account I asked them for the company address (I hadn't realized it yet, but I had no record of their address except that they were located in Mississauga ON). They wouldn't give me their company address, they told me to use my own or a previous company I worked for as it would make the process of setting up the account happen today (rather than in 10 tens time if I used their business). So I did them one better, I had looked them up on the BBB and found their address. I also found a different phone number than what was on their website... by the way, the phone number on the website went straight to voicemail and said 'leave a message' to which no one ever called me back, and I left 4 messages (that was it), and the phone number on the BBB went nowhere, it was a number that didn't ring. Anyhow, once I finished setting up my account with Goldmoney, I let them know and they in turn asked me to give them my account sign-in information along with my passwords. They were going to give the 'client' this information, let them do business using the account and I would get 5%.

I told them they weren't getting squat from me and that I was going to report them, they immediately deleted any conversations they could to try and hide anything that was discussed (the had me use the 'Telegram' app, they said it was the quickest and easiest way for communication).

A number of days later (on May 21st), I received an email stating that this client services assistant position has already been filled, but there is another position available, cashier, that they would like to offer me. (I initially found this email strange because the name of the company on the Indeed job posting, VTR Technical, was different than the company name, Hellanback Solutions Inc., on this email.The first email was from a ""Luisa James"" at VTR Technical, and the second email was from a ""Jessica Wilson"" at Hellanback Solutions Inc.) The email contained a link to the company website that described the cashier position. Honestly, I skimmed the page, wasn't really paying attention to what I was reading, and clicked the link at the bottom of the page to continue with the job application. This page asked for me to enter my email, first and last name, phone number, city, postal code, and hours of availability, which I did. A couple days later (on May 24th), I received another email (this time from a ""Samantha Bishop"" at Hellanback Solutions Inc.) telling me that they are offering me a ""probationary period with an opportunity for permanent employment"" in the cashier position. All that I need to do is confirm that I have a smartphone with a camera to continue with the employment process. Almost everything about this company and job offer seem like a scam to me. Basically no qualifications are needed for this position, I have only been in contact with them over email, the company emailing me is different than the one I originally applied for (I could also not really find anything about the other company, VTR Technical, online), and every email I've received has been from a different person. Also, the ""cashier"" position itself is the biggest red flag. For whatever reason, I hadn't really paid much attention to the cashier job description at first, but after the last email I received I went back and reread it, and it sounds super sketchy: Job duties: ""receiving payments, withdrawing cash from the bank account, exchanging cash using crypto currency ATMs, improvement of the invoices processing efficiency, and performing reports."" I haven't performed any of these job duties, since I am not accepting the job offer and will not be emailing them back, so I haven't actually been scammed yet. But everything about the interactions I have had with this company, the company website, and the cashier position description have led me to believe that this employment offer is a scam and this company will try to scam me if I accept this job. Hopefully I described this encounter in enough detail. I have attached screenshots of the emails I received. The website listing information on the cashier position is hellanback.io/cashier. I am happy to provide any other information needed.","{'la': 53.49463, 'lo': -113.635814, 'rlo': -1.983319102483867, 'rla': 0.9336574256361341}",0.0

It seemed that he was calling me from his home or at his personal space. The ultimate red flags about this job offer was the request to scan and send them my personal information - passport/Driver license. The paragraph below is the message that the company have sent me in the email: We have finalized the selection process for the position of Quality Control Agent that you have applied for, and I am very pleased to be able to offer you a job.

R2M 0L4,"Mar 19, 2019",Viacom International Media Networks,"The scammer first had a ""recruiter"" reach out to me on LinkedIn, with a complete profile that matched the VIACOM website. He provided me very specific details about the job offer in a very professional manner, stating Viacom was attempting to start a new programme, that aimed at hiring employees through international and online networks, due to the increasing advancements and use of technology and asked for an email to use for the primary contact. I have found employment through recruiters before on Linkedin with very respectable companies so this did not raise any red flags - especially considering they provided me with the website, and all contact details - except for phone contact, but did include a skype account - VIACOMRecruits.  I reviewed a significant amount of information online, which made me reassured with this company as being legitimate, what I did not think of was that current OR past employees, as well as, scammers who have never worked with the company, could possibly steal all this information AND MORE - to legitimize their scam. Whitney was the main form of contact through email and asked me almost 20 or more questions over the course of a week to see if I would be a suitable candidate. All questions were normal and professional some which were personal, but would be asked by any employer.., as were the communications generally throughout the week. Whitney also uses a signature and a profile picture all correlated to the website and the company logo and even provided a LEGITIMATE CONTRACT WITH VIACOM HEAD OF OPERATIONS SIGNATURE AND LOGO. Along the way, Whitney asked if I would be available for a Skype interview and, as someone who has done several of these for international companies, no flags were raised. Whitney was also able to answer all my questions regarding the company, hiring standards and policy, which makes me assume the individual is a CURRENT OR FORMER EMPLOYEE. However, when the day came, she was ""experiencing computer issues"" and could only facilitate a Google Hangouts, which started to raise some suspicions, but because of how the course of the whole interaction has gone, I did facilitate this conversation in which she offered the job of being an Online Administrative Assistant for either a full-time or part-time position, and requested I submit the contract by 6 pm UK time to be processed, as well as some ID's to verify my identity. I submitted the contract as well as the form provided by my bank for direct deposit. With this, they have stolen money from me, opened accounts on behalf of myself and more than likely shared information to other parties - I have closed all accounts associated with the contact and have reached out to the city police who informed someone in the government. Whitney has either blocked me on all accounts and so has the recruiter, or both have deleted their accounts. I have attempted to contact VIACOM's legitimate business and they have not responded to any forms of communication between their social media accounts, emails and have even reached out to specific offices located in North America and the UK.","{'la': 49.862135, 'lo': -97.105367, 'rlo': -1.694808375507448, 'rla': 0.8702584278239021}",500.0
M2K 1G9,"Mar 19, 2019",Attwood Recruitment Solutions Ltd.,"Please read my instructions. This information is useful to you and it is very important for you. Why does our company use Bitcoin to pay for jobs. Clients of our company are sponsors for training new personnel so that after an internship in our company outstanding specialists in their field would go out. 1. Zero or very low commission: The commissions are practically independent of the amount transferred or from the location of the sending and receiving parties. Often transactions are free. The commission is required only for the formation of technically large transactions that load the network, or very small amounts, to avoid an attack on the network by spamming a huge number of meaningless transactions. 2. Instant transfers: In banks, transfers between accounts take on average 3-5 business days, or more, if they are foreign transfers. In crypto currency transactions are instantaneous. However, when working with large amounts, it is recommended to wait for several confirmations by the transaction network, usually it takes less than an hour. 3. Safety, reliability, security: In crypto-currency to store the access keys to the funds, we use proven cryptography with a division into open and private keys. Similar algorithms are used by banks and other financial organizations to protect their data. And the total processing power of the Bitcoin network, which is used to protect the history of transactions, in 2012 exceeded the computing power of any supercomputer in the world. I'll give you one Bitcoin account of our company. And I'll teach you how to use it. Of course, you will need some bitcoins. We will provide you with funds for this reason. I'll help you buy bitcoins. We need to be able to transfer money to you so that you can buy bitcoin for work. Popular methods of bank transfers: 1. Direct Deposit. 2. E-Transfer Interac. Are you familiar with the transmission of e-transaction? All transactions in our company are made through the bank. This is a confirmation of the reliability of our money. We cooperate exclusively with banks! All transactions are conducted under the supervision of the bank's security service. About any expenses: You do not need to spend money from your pocket. All fees that you will have you can pay from the amount you receive. Your initial capital will be distributed to 2-3 transfers. All information about taxes I will provide you with your salary when you finish the internship. This is your second task in our company. All transactions are protected by our security team. Our company works only with reliable customers. All information will not be passed to third parties. Let me know if you're ready proceed to the second task.

I received a response fairly shortly back that advised they were opening a business in my city (no city was actually listed) in April and they were looking for hire people quickly. I was to respond to the email to accept the position. The email did include a list of qualifications, a pdf with a job description, and a link to their website: aenetwork.ca. The grammar in the email was decent but not great, there was no contact name included and when I went to the website, it was down for ""scheduled maintenance"". I attempted to google the business as they stated they were branching out from Montreal but there is zero information posted anywhere else about the company online. They have sent me some electronic forms to sign for agreements. I didn't fill any of those out. On their website they said they are partnered with companies such as Air Canada, Destination Canada, and the Aboriginal Tourism Association. I reached out to them and they confirmed they are not partnered with this company. After I checked with them, I did not respond to any more emails with AE Network, so beyond my personal information, I'm not sure what they were after. As I couldn't find any prior history for this company's scam, I just wanted to make sure I reported it so others could find it much easier before they gave them anything.","{'la': 51.270897, 'lo': -114.0364, 'rlo': -1.990310647121261, 'rla': 0.894845963100883}",0.0
J8Y 2E9,"Mar 11, 2019",Undiscovered Talent Group,"We found the ad on Facebook and filled in a webform stating our interest in the auditions.  We were then invited to an audition.  At this 1st meeting, there was a video powerpoint about their company.  We were there, one by one, invited to meet one of their employee for a short interview (approx 5 to 8 mins) and mini auditioning, then right away told that we 'kinda of like your child' and could we meet again the next day for a 2nd auditioning, but that they would confirm the same night if this 2nd meeting still stand.  Later in the day, it was confirmed to come the next day.  At that 2nd supposively auditioning, we were right away told about their fees (even before proceeding to the 2nd auditioning). The 1st meeting made us think that they would do multiple auditioning BEFORE telling us that they would register us.  It was NEVER mentioned about fees in the 1st meeting to make people come back.  This company misleads people to think they will have a chance to show their talent but barely takes time to see if you have talent but quickly asks for deposit without getting to know you. The company claims to be seeking new talent so holds auditions. When you rsquo re asked to come back they demand a fee in US currency claiming it rsquo s for an opportunity to be in front of talent agents etc but the company itself ARE NOT talent agents. Law stipulates that no agent can receive payment until the talent is compensated by work which is usually a 10% commission. I am very disappointed at the way this company proceeds and makes believe the people (especially the children) that they are going to help you with your dream.  It is very sad to take advantage of people like that.  Luckely I got myself informed and DID NOT sign or pay anything, I stopped the process and did not pursue.

They attached this poorly written PDF file to read over that details the job summary and FAQs. After reading that I got even more suspicious as the grammar/spelling mistakes in there were even worse!

Such a cheap put together site with not many working buttons, links that took you nowhere, and the ""Contact"" Us"" section was extremely vague  with only a small section for you to fill out a form to send them. No actual address, names, numbers or anything.. After Googling Mystery Shopper scams it became abundantly clear to me that this was a scam. I emailed this ""David Patel"" back asking him for more details and suspecting that this may be a scam and he has yet to get back to me...

T3Z 1J4,"Feb 22, 2019",President Youth Program,"I applied using Indeed.ca and was contacted by the ""Company"" HR department telling me that they were looking over my resume to see if I would be a good fit for the job. I was then contacted by HR again with an employment contract. The contract stated my pay, that I would be working from home, and that I would be creating opportunities for students to travel from all over the world to Canada. I was then told to use Telegram in order to communicate with my ""boss"" Brenda Pais. I received my first assignment which told me to create a presentation about my home town or province and to include activities to take part in. The second assignment had me find hotels that would be in a lower price range for visiting students and finally my last assignment had me find International University Student opportunities. During the two weeks I had worked for the company I was contacted by my employer and told that I needed to make payments to a Hostel in Halifax by using a BitCoin machine. The money was transferred to me then I was asked to put the money in the BitCoin machine and send photos of the receipts. I was asked to do this 5 times in the span of 3 days. During this period I was told to track my hours as they would calculate the hours at the end of a two week period and then I would get paid. I never received any money and a few days before the ""payday"" I was cut off of all communication from my boss and I have not heard anything since.

I rsquo m looking for work so I expressed my interest. I then received an email from Oscar Elliot, telling me that I was selected for a screening process and a chance to apply to the operations manager position they have available. They sent me the position information, including a high hourly pay rate and flexible hours. They then ask you to fill out an application and send it back where they accept your application right away. They then instruct me to download the messaging app  ldquo telegram rdquo  for communication. Once you message them in telegram, they tell you that they are setting up a 7-10 minute phone interview and coordinate it with you. The interview consisted of about 2 questions, my availability, and my strongest business asset and then telling me that I will be starting in a probationary period which will require me to use my own bank account to process payment from customers before sending it back to the company. I questioned them on this and they said they would never ask me to use my own funds for any transactions. After the quick phone  ldquo interview rdquo  I was immediately messaged on telegram by Oscar letting me know that I was selected and to choose which shift I wanted. (I stayed in the interview that I was unavailable to work for 2 weeks because I would have to give my current employer notice.) I read over the labour agreement and there were some fishy sections that I questioned them about, like a section that stated  ldquo the employer is entitled to deduct from the employees compensation, or from any other compensation, in whatever form, any applicable deductions and remittances as required by law rdquo . When asked about this, Oscar stated that they would only deduct pay if you disappear. Which I found strange because that makes it seem like a lot of their employees  ldquo disappear rdquo . I then became increasingly curious about the legitimacy of this so I did some digging and it was hard to find, but I found a forum warning people about the logistic company scams out there and their methods. A lot of it seems to be to either launder money or use employees as mules for goods bought with stolen credit cards. I reached the end of the thread where G-Transzone logistics was mentioned by name as a scam and felt it was my duty to report.

He asked for references. He asked typing and data entry speed but didn't test for it. He was hard to understand. When I asked him questions he kept telling me to refer to the website for information. He explained that there is a two week training period of $16/hr and I would be given the equipment (laptop, printer) in order to do the work. Two days later I was offered the job. I was told I would be assigned a supervisor. I asked where I should go for my training and he indicated there wasn't a place where I would be trained. I asked how I would be trained then and he didn't answer. He didn't ask if I accept the offer, he just told me to sign the attached document he sent in an email. The email asks for bank account information ( a scan of a black voided cheque ) and a scan of my government pictured ID. There is no mention of a supervisor and no further information on the job itself. Through further research, I found a site that looked legit and a site that seemed to try to mirror the legit site but with some inconsistencies - the Toronto branch had a Detroit MI phone number as it's contact number. When called, the caller is directed to leave a message without any indication of the company called, where the legit looking website has a 1-888 # and when calling that number, the automated greeting clearly stated the company name and offered several options for contacting people within the organization. I called Brian Switzer's phone number by mistake thinking I was calling the BBB back, he answered ""Hello"" rather than answering the call by identifying who he is and identifying the company name. The contract was rife with formatting errors, spelling, and grammar errors. I really felt that if I gave my banking information, I would be scammed so I declined the offer and didn't sign any documents. I really didn't feel that I would be meeting with a supervisor and be given computer equipment to do any data entry work. I felt that once I gave that bank information, he would run with it.","{'la': 43.648099, 'lo': -79.366092, 'rlo': -1.385199619840731, 'rla': 0.761803039786444}",0.0

R3Y ,"Jan 10, 2019",Canada Reporter,"I am a student and try to look for a part-time job. I send some resumes to potential employers through indeed. A few days later I got an email from someone who claims his name is John Owens, the HR Manager of Canada reporters. In the email, he told me my application was accepted. in order to complete the selection procedure,  I need to check on the job description and f then fill out an application form with some personal information like name, address, available hours for work and also 3 referees from former employers or teachers from school. In the application form it also states that if it's a part-time job, an interview is not required. I thought those are reasonable request, and maybe they will call later for a phone interview. so I completed the form and reply to Mr. John Owens. Next day morning, I received a job offer from Mr. Owens. He asks me to provide the scan copy of my passport and driver license so they will arrange insurance coverage for me. I feel suspicious as I am not quite convinced that anyone could get a job without an interview. so I google the company but I feel even more suspicious after googling it because below 3 reasons: 1. I can't find any tracks of the company except their own website canadareport.ca and another almost identical website canadianreportersltd.ca. 2. They claim they are news agency, but all articles are copied from Reuters but none of the articles indicates sources or authors/ reporters' name. 3. The phone number on canadareporter.ca is the same with HR Managers'. I feel confused so I call Mr. Owens to ask their address and the relationship between Canada reporter and Canadian reporter ltd. The reply from Mr. Owen is that, they are in Toronto but they are moving to my city so they don't have the local address right now. These 2 websites are under the same media group, but right now they are independent. When I try to ask more professional questions like their article source, Mr. Owen said he can't hear me because the phone signal is not very well, therefore he asks me to write him an email. However, I didn't get any reply since.

The credit card is being shipped from the Company Head-quarters here - You will get your Business Credit card within 7-14 days being a Company certified Credit Card...We will be making use of your Credit card for now.

You are advice to take out any available funds you have in it, so you won't say the company tempered with your money or account. The transfer process is completed automatically after being secured into the accounting security and payment system.... - The payment won rsquo t be from your personal funds Okay - The company will be making a payment into your credit card for now so you can purchase your working equipment today and you will be getting it by weekend. - Good i need you to provide me with a clear snap of front and back of your credit card with the online information So payment can be made into it and you will head down to the store for the purchase of your working equipment (note that they said I would need to purchase my own equipment to an actual store) They tried to put $5000 in my credit card but it wasn't working so they asked me for my debit card info which I stupidly gave without a thought. I did asked her why she needed my username and password when they could just transfer the money through my email and she snapped ""Is there a problem?"" They did manage to deposit money to my debit card account $1,550 and $1800 the next day. She then asked me to pay $750 to my credit card so it's available to be used for I don't know what, withdraw $800 from my debit card to send via moneygram to Mr Banjo Oreoluwa CITY: Newark STATE: New Jersey ZIP CODE: 07112 and emphasized that i don't have to put any other information, and buy $1800 worth of steam gift cards all in $100 denominations. I told her I could only withdraw and send $500 because that's my limit on my card so i sent this person $500CAD ($366USD), she even got angry why it's only $366 so i told her that's the exchange rate. The next day I was asked to buy those steam gift cards and had to tell her again that i could only use $500 since it is my limit (per day but i didn't tell her that). She then insisted that there's no limit if I just swiped my card. I told her ""Mrs Bethany, card swipe here in Canada has limits in case of cards being stolen or fraudulently used."" So she just asked me to proceed with the $500. I was already on my way out to my bank but my gut just kept telling me that this is a scam and thinking about it just screams scam and so many red flags so I did my research and found one on here that is very similar to my situation. I then emailed her that I no longer want the job and that it is in my best interest to do so because it just screams SCAM. I also sent her a screenshot of the same scam on here. I also changed all my credit and debit card info after as well as called to change my card numbers. She then sent me this: ""Let me be honest here with you There are so many scams out there and it has really made it difficult for people to know the difference between a legit job offer and a scam offer The scam companies are now using the exact same techniques of we the Legit company in hiring and its has really made it difficult I don rsquo t know why you still skeptical about this."" I replied: ""I was on my way to the bank but then I questioned why I need to go buy those cards now when I'm still waiting for my working equipment? You said you're going to send them to me but why do I still need funds to buy it if you're sending them anyway? If you're a legit company then shouldn't you have done all of the purchasing yourself and just install all the software needed in the computer and send them to me?Also when I sent the moneygram there were so many restrictions you gave me and telling me to just tick the box like you're afraid to put any additional information at all. I'm a part time Cyber Security student and I'm being trained to know the red flags and where to look for scams and this just screams it. If it does turn out to be a scam then shame on me for believing, if not then I will apologize and transfer you back the money that hasn't been used as well as the money taken for my loans.  I will contact you once I made sure my bank account is safe in 5-7 business days. Thank you and have a good day Mrs Bethany Pirttima.""

K0L 2W0,"Jan 05, 2019",,"I received a telephone call from Ashley Z      stating I had expressed interest in making money online. (It is possible that I clicked on such a link, although I had no specific memory of doing so.)  She played a recording that briefly described          's promo for obtaining ""agents"".  Then, a man named Michael F        came on the line and further explained their offer. I am an affiliate marketer with 2 years experience.  I know quite a lot about how to sell online, what works and what doesn't work and what a legitimate offer looks and sounds like.  The           offer is a scam, in my opinion.  At the very least, it is filled with holes and some outright lies. As explained by Mr. F       , I could become an ""agent"" for the company and would not have to do any ""selling"" or spend any money on advertising.  All I would have to do is get leads for the company which, according to him, I could get via social media marketing for free or by talking with local businesses whenever I am out and about, and I would only need to spend 4 hours a week doing this to be successful. I would be compensated when the company closed a sale.  He said the company has 7 services they offer (I only found 6 on their website) and I would be compensated 25% of each sale. My compensation for some sales would be $1000.  As other people became agents in my territory, they would be placed under me and I would receive some compensation on their sales. The compensation sounded like a two-tiered affiliate plan as apposed to an MLM, so I mentioned this and he agreed.  I asked if my leads would be ""lifetime"" leads and he said they would. (This means that if my lead purchases anything else from the company in the future, I would receive a commission for these sales too.  Two-tiered, lifetime affiliate compensation plans are fairly common and completely legitimate as far as I know.) Mr. F        said the cost for becoming an ""agent"" was $1500 which would give me a website, video training and conversations with other agents. Here are my complaints regarding this offer: 1.  The claim that I would not have to do any ""selling"" is false, and frankly, ridiculous. Obtaining leads is a sales function/activity, so it is in no way removed from ""selling"". 2.  The claim that I would not need to spend any money on advertising is equally false and ridiculous.  Free social media marketing alone would never produce the volume of leads that would be required for even just one sale.  Paid advertising plus free social media marketing is the only way to get enough leads because not every lead ends up making a purchase (just 10% would be a great rate, but even 10% is rare.) 3.  The claim that the website/training/conversations is worth $1500 is VERY misleading, in my opinion.  Since the activities required are essentially affiliate marketing, it is very easy to find effective training online, completely free.  I believe the company is not being honest and transparent by not identifying that this offer is essentially a simple two-tiered affiliate marketing role. (Affiliate marketers are NEVER asked to pay anything to the companies they work with....NEVER....if the company is legitimately looking for affiliate marketers.) 4.  The claim that I would only need to work 4 hours a week is also ridiculous.  Even 4 hours a day might not be enough, and I have 2 years experience. He claimed that there were agents making $3,000 to $5,000 per month and only needing to spend a few hours a day at most.  This would be great, if it were true.  For sure, a newbie could never expect to make that kind of money from only a few hours a day of work and not spending any money on advertising. 5.  I am a Canadian, so I asked Mr. F        if the company sold their services to Canadians.  He claimed that there were other Canadian ""agents"".  However, he had no knowledge of the different legal requirements for loans in Canada (one of their services is to help business owners get loans), and he seemed to think there were no signficant differences between Canada and the US in this regard.  He was excited about the fact that I was the first one in Ontario, so I would end up having lots of agents under me in the compensation plan, and therefore more passive income.  But he refused to give me time to find out if sales of their services was even allowed in Canada. 6.  The sales tactics used by Mr. F        were extremely ""hard-sell"" as indicated above.  When I said I wanted to do some research first before making a decision, he could have arranged another conversation with me, but instead, the only way I could end the call was to hang up on him. He actually freely admitted that I either had to make a purchase today or hang up on him, in order to end the call. It was crystal clear that he had no interest in my inability to make an informed decision. For all of these reasons, I believe that the           nbsp offer is a scam.  And it is no surprise to me that they are selling it by phone instead of online, where their program would more likely be identified as a scam by many and not just me.  Even their website has no information about this offer.","{'la': 44.334741, 'lo': -78.588795, 'rlo': -1.371633227924857, 'rla': 0.773787203468923}",0.0

I told her I would return her call to see if I could get a better connection.  I called the number listed in her e-mail.  The recording promptly informed me that the number was ""unsigned"". I e-mailed her and told her the number listed in her e-mail was invalid.

I had been looking for a job recently but did not remember doing that. I will copy and paste the exact email he originally sent me at the end. He attempted to call me every day in the morning which was odd because I had given him a time to best get me and that was way out of the time slot. He left a voicemail saying  ldquo this is Rick Murphy please call me back  ldquo  but didn rsquo t leave a phone number but I had call I rsquo d on my phone. Anyways I tried calling that number back and the first few times it would just keep on ringing and there was never an answering machine or anything. The last few times I called it would ring twice and then a busy signal. I emailed him telling him I tried calling there was no answer or answering machine blah blah and never heard back until a few days later when he emailed me saying he rsquo s tried calling and didn rsquo t get me and to call him back on the number I had already been calling so he did finally give me a number but not until towards the end of about 5 days. I then tried a few more times and got the same result when I called so I sent him an email saying I rsquo m not sure what to do as I rsquo ve tried calling. I then tried looking up the company and the only one I could find was in the UK. So all of those things together made me realize it rsquo s a scam so I want to warn people. Luckily I didn rsquo t and would never give out any banking info and I rsquo m not sure how he got my information to begin with although I have been applying to a bunch of places through Indeed so maybe they had a fake add or something.

Before going into the pay information he said all he needs is my banking information.  I said you must be mistaken because if you are for real this is a scam.  I suggested he probably meant email money transfers.  he didn't seem to have a clue about that.  he talked a bit saying he has 110 customers and 11 drivers in Calgary.  His Zallat linkedin account shows 6 followers and 3 employees!  On facebook there are about 3 or 4 people that like his comments on Zallat and they are all friends of each others, and all from same culture  I think Somalia.  some of the facebook prfiles all have the same saying about allah.  he didn't seem to have a clue about things and went with the flow of how i was asking questions.  he said that most of the clients are lawyers and doctors as i said i work for a few doctors. LOL  he told me he would email me the expectations and he never did.  i sent him a text to 587-432-     to remind him and he said 'my bad' and he will do it right away.  i never got the email (3 days ago).  he told me to email or call on the website my availability by sunday for the week ahead.  this information i felt he made up on the spot as i was asking what day you would need to email availability by.  he said the pay scale is $5 per order and you get 7.5 % of total grocery bill. LOL.  his fees on the site show $19.99 a month for unlimited deliveries if you buy over $35 each time.  or a yearly fee of $149 with unlimited deliveries.  LOL  if a customer does 10 orders in a month you are paying the delivery person 10 times $5 = $50 plus 7.5 % of total groceries.  the company would have to be losing $ right and left.  if you look online for Zallat you will find his picture.  he is the darker toned person.  2 Asian people are supposedly they computer programmers.  i think he is trying to get people who have no clue and perhaps get them to do a test deposit to him or something as he tested me with saying he would need my banking information.  his tune changed after that.  his website also says you need a criminal check but nothing was every done  no paperwork  no forms  no nothing.   just talking to me to see if I am gullible enough.  i do not know why he has his picture on the website and linkedin though.  very bad website.","{'la': 50.996868, 'lo': -114.07394, 'rlo': -1.99096584372246, 'rla': 0.8900632548049351}",0.0

I responded to the email asking to for the company name and location of employment (thinking it may have been an overlooked human error in the first message). The response came with the company name, a more detailed description of the job as well as the location of employment - home based. The company name provided actually did not match with the very first message I received, the out of home employment was suspicious considering the wage they were offering. I looked into the company ""Safe Logistics Inc"" and found an almost nonexistent online presence for a company claiming on their website to have been around for 20+ years.

I applied to so many jobs that sometimes I can not even remember that I applied for the particular job position. I received an email on 5th of Sept 2018 from CANEWS.TODAY and they claimed they reviewed my resume on indeed and they want to offer me a position of Quality Control Agent. It was a part-time position with a trail of 30 Business Days. They wanted me to go to the different places like bank, mall, hotel and Restaraunt as a customer to check their service and get back to them with the survey form that they provided me. First two days were good and I never realised that it was a scam, they sent me to a restaurant and mall for the first two days. On Wednesday the 12th of sept, 2018, they didn't send me an email regarding my task so I emailed them that I didn't receive and task and they said their server is down so I am off today. On Thursday the 13th of sept, 2018, they called me and said I need to go to the Scotiabank today and check their customer service as they received a complaint that they take more than 40 minutes on one customer. Afterwards, he said he will send me an interac and I need to deposit that money into my Scotia bank account and send them back immediately to their company via Bitcoin ATM. I asked them if it is compulsory to do that as I was not feeling good to use my account to accept or withdraw the money. I told him that I am already a Scotiabank customer so I can ask the question regarding my account to check their quality of service but he denied me to do that and he said if I want to work with CANEWS.TODAY as a quality control agent or not as he manipulated me that he can promote me as a manager if I can keep doing this job according to their rules and regulations. I asked him that I am not feeling secure about using my bank account but he assured me that CANEWS.TOADY is reputed and dignified company and nothing negative will happen on my bank account. He claimed that CANEWS.TODAY will pay for all the charges and expenses happen to my account. I did as he told me to do and he provided me with the location of bank and bitcoin atm. He sent me two interact e  transfer with the amount of $1990.80 and $1985.00 and I deposited the whole amount back in the bitcoin atm. When I get home I opened an account to check one of my payment that was supposed to go on 14th of Sept, 2018 but I was unable to open my bank account on the mobile app. Then I logged in to my web to see if there is any kind of problem with my mobile app and then I came to know that my bank account is suspended. I called the Scotia bank right away and customer representative asked me if everything is okay at that point I was unable to hold anything back and I told her everything. Next day I went to my bank and got the new card. On Saturday that is today, my friend sent me an interact on my email when I tried to deposit into my bank account they said I need to contact my financial institute to check if everything is alright. I called my bank and them and my email is in the fraudulent list and they need few business days to resolve this and they will contact me and interact department if they need any further information. Now my mail is in the fraudulent list and my friend who sent me an interact of $500, his money is on hold and they sent his email in the fraudulent department for further investigation. When I filled a job application for CANEWS.TODAY they wanted me to send my identification proof. I sent them my DL as an identity proof but now I know they are fraud and I do not want them to use my personal ID.

K1H 6M9,"Sep 10, 2018",Verttag Corp,"verview The job/employment scam takes advantage of those who are seeking work. Individuals are offered a job without needing to have an in-person meeting with the employer. The target is asked to receive money from an unknowingly-compromised bank account. They are then asked to withdraw cash in order to purchase bitcoins.These bitcoins are, in turn, sent to the wallet address of the scammer. Demographic of targets: The elderly, recent immigrants, the young (students with little knowledge of legal systems), and workers who receive payment under the table How it Works The scammer will contact a job seeker through an email, or phone call, and offer them a job. If the job seeker believes that this job offer is legitimate, they will accept their offer and follow the scammers rsquo  subsequent instructions. The instructions will involve funneling money from a compromised bank account controlled by the scammer, into the target rsquo s bank account  this is done via Interac e-Transfer. The target will then be instructed to withdraw most of the transferred money, with the difference being the target rsquo s compensation. The target is then requested to use the withdrawn money to purchase bitcoins at a Bitcoin ATM, and send them to the scammer rsquo s wallet address. When the compromised bank account rsquo s holder discovers money missing, they will report it to their local authorities, who will ask the bank to reverse the transaction. After the transaction is reversed, the target will be left at a loss, having already withdrawn the money sent to them. Prevention: Stay Alert The majority of jobs will require a physical presence for an interview. Always be skeptical when being offered a job. Be particularly cautious of any jobs that claim to be  lsquo remote rsquo  or  lsquo work-from-home rsquo . Be wary of any job offers made on-the-spot, through an email or a phone call, and without an interview. It is also very important that you  never accept money transfers from anyone you do not know. Most certainly, the chances are that the funds are coming from a compromised bank account. A job will also most certainly never involve conducting business out of a target rsquo s personal bank account. Any job that is easy to obtain, with easy pay, is most likely too good to be true. It is always good to have a healthy dose of skepticism.","{'la': 45.387372, 'lo': -75.648573, 'rlo': -1.320316673285284, 'rla': 0.792159080227483}",2000.0
B0J 1N0,"Sep 08, 2018",Verttag Corporation,"As I am currently unemployed, I have been looking for jobs on a lot of job sites and applying to a lot of different positions. As a result of this I had not been keeping track of which companies I had applied to. Thus, when Charlotte Natoc of Verttag Corporation contacted me with a job offering, I assumed it had been one that I had applied to. The first email I received was asking me to email back if I was interested in the job. The second email I received had an attachment describing the positions available, which were basic office jobs, as well as the pay. There was also a 5 day training period. I was asked to choose which position I was interested in, as well as answering a few basic questions: How do you feel about working in a team  What do you need to feel comfortable at work  What position are you most interested in  Why are you the best candidate for the respective position  What are your best personal qualities  When would you be ready to start working. About 6 hours after receiving the second email, I received another asking if I had received the email and to respond as soon as possible. I assumed that they were just trying to be nice at this point, and sent off my responses to the questions. The next email I received asked me to fill out an employee contract and send a copy of an official ID. It was at this point I started to get suspicious of the company. I had previously searched the internet for any information on this company, as well as looking at their company website. They are registered with a certified business number on the Canada Government website, as well as many others, and their website looks pretty legitimate. However, when I called their listed phone number there was no response and not even a voicemail. In hind-site, this should have been enough to convince me, but I was still really interested in the position as it had good pay and I thought I would really enjoy the job as it had been described to me. So I filled out the employee contract, with my basic information (name, address, contact information, signature) and sent a photocopy of my driver's licence with the master number erased, as I was still unsure of the security of my information. The next email I received was to congratulate me on becoming a member of their company. Up to this point I had not spoken to any one other than this one individual by email, I had not had a formal interview of any sort (just the few questions I had answered), and I had not even been told where the position would be located, as it was an office job. This email continued to ask me for my banking information so that they could set up my payments. At this point I dug deeper into this organization. Their address, when searched, is actually for a business called ""Ontario Consumers Home Services"". While the Canada Government website does have them listed as a business, it is very unclear what they actually do. And finally, I called their listed number a few more times, and still there was no response. At this point I was pretty skeptical that this business was legitimate, so I responded to the email stating that I was happy to be offered the position, but I refused to give anymore information until I talked or met with someone, and was told where the office was located. The response I received is attached below, and basically told me that this was standard procedure and I should feel comfortable with the security of my information with them. Besides the emails I have described above, there were about 3 additional emails in-between that asked me if I had received the information sent previously and to respond asap, even though the total length of our contact was about 3 days. However, since my last email, asking about the security of my information, I have not received any other emails, therefore I can say this 100% appears to be a scam. I am not sure what the procedure is to obtain a business number, but I have to believe that these people have been quite successful at scamming people, as they have gone out of their way obtain a business number and to make their company appear very legitimate at first glance. I hope that you can shut down this business so that they don't continue to scam unemployed individuals at such a vulnerable time.","{'la': 44.825467, 'lo': -63.257288, 'rlo': -1.104047951482298, 'rla': 0.782351987894065}",0.0

We do not share any of your details with any other third party. How will I get selected for an assignment? At Hot Review LLC we ask you to complete a questionnaire about yourself so we can select the assignments that are best suited to you and the area where you live. How long do the assignments take?

Looking at their website, it seems alright, but further inspection proves to reveal oddities. Firstly, their phone number does not work, secondly, their testimonials repeatedly mention the company ""Golden Review"" and a single individual ""Jen Wells""... not only one person works at a company. The most hilarious line within their website is, ""We don rsquo t just hire  ldquo anyone rdquo  and we certainly don rsquo t mass-hire everyone who applies"", which is DEFINITELY something that someone who does exactly that would assert. These scammers are stupid and malicious, preying on desperate just-graduated individuals who are looking to survive in this capitalist driven          of an existence. The most IRONIC thing is that they're"" hiring"" inspectors, who would be very detail oriented and attentive to any strange occurrences, and thus would be most attuned to picking up on these red flags. Anyways, they had a short phone interview with me, asking about myself and my job experiences, asking whether I was interested in part or full time employment. Immediately after the phone call I was provided with a job offer, where I had a contract to sign and a T4 sheet...no banking information page/direct deposit form so they would be able to actually pay me.. but they're a scam so that's actually not necessary. Again.. DETAILS. Below is the contract attached with the T4:                                                                                                                   Page 1 Hot Review LLC 3415 Rue Pierre-Ardouin, Ville de Qu eacute bec, QC G1P 0B3 +1 418 266 3772 info@hotreviewllc.com www.hotreviewllc.com EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT All shop inspector are Employee of company Hot Review LLC.

She posted that DATA ENTRY personnel are needed ASAP for this company, and to message her for more details.  She provided me the email covance2018@gmail.com (RED FLAG RIGHT THERE) and told me I needed to add them on Google Hangouts in order to interview and get more information. They asked for picture of ID, full name, and address, and a video saying I pledge to do my best and follow instructions of the company, and my supervisor.  It was to be a data entry position, that they would be paying me $20 an hour for.  They were going to send me a laptop, and funds to purchase software for the computer that I would need in order to do the data entry. That all sounded good and fine.  They told me I had to report online the next day at 9 am.  At 844am they started messaging, and told me the computer would be shipping the following day, and I would have everything in 2 days. In the meantime, they needed my bank info so they could ""send me money"".  Yet they asked for my login and password, and security question and password (RED FLAG RIGHT THERE).  I told them that they can E-transfer me the money and I will tell them when I had it.  At this point I was very suspicious and started digging around online, and all the little clues came together. No international company would be using their company name and the year as their email address, nor would they be using a @GMAIL.COM account.

V2N 5N7,"Jun 19, 2018",CNC Machining Ltd ,"First she contacted me by email her name was Rachel Tennyson. I never applied for this position. They gave me option for 2 positions operations manager or cash manager. The operation manager position offered 108,900 annually and the cash manager position was 89,000. They said I was there top choice out of 20 people. As I read the email I noticed she spelt words wrong and made small punctuation errors the first email looked copied and pasted. The forms they sent seemed legit all spelled correctly even the last forms seemed to have a stamp of approval. They gave me the job after filling out 2 forms and no phone call. The number they did give when you call it all you get is a robots voice all lines are full call back later. Sounded like a voicemail beep at the end. I did some research they have a employee comment on glass door but it was only positive. Also they are hiring everywhere to work on the machines but only one legit business location no head office just contact numbers. The website seemed very thoroughly made. Kind of expensive but the number again was robotic with no official head office location. I called the Kelowna branch they were legit. They said this is the second time they have been called this month. The other position was a relocation job to Quebec and it paid 104,000 annually. This was a machinist position. They told them they aren rsquo t hiring for that job there vacancy was full. Unfortunately the Operation Manager refused to talk to me as well. It wasn rsquo t a fake email it had @machiningltd.com at the end. So again I didn rsquo t see any problem with it. They also said no phone interviews will happen because they information will be confidential so no information will be leaked to their competition. Than they made download an app called telegram messenger. Where they would contact me through that again no phone interview. My suspicion arrived when they said that bitcoin would be how the customers pay. How you will pay for an office. How you pay for supplies with bitcoin. This is where I declined the position and deleted everything.","{'la': 53.867417, 'lo': -122.819111, 'rlo': -2.143597871322385, 'rla': 0.940163786194766}",0.0

H4V ,"Jun 12, 2018",Simple Performance HR Solutions Inc,"I'm a newcomer to Canada, and so I was applying for many jobs online. One day, I get this job offer to work online for a recruiting company, and the salary was very high, so immediately I was more than happy to take the job. I first had to do the training for 10 days, which was what they called my ""probation period"", and everyday we had to do a task. I only got to do two, the first being, posting a job offer on Indeed, and the second one being, receiving $1500 in the bank through INTERAC e-transfer (which works when you give only your name, your email,and the address of the bank you use)  and depositing it in a Bitcoin ATM for a client. Now I looked up a lot of things about bitcoins because I didn't know whether to trust them or not, and they seemed trustworthy, it seemed like a lot of people use them no problem, but what I constantly scold myself for is that it never came to my mind, I never asked myself, not once, why they would have me do it, instead of doing it themselves, if it wasn't illegal. Now, after I stopped receiving emails from them, and because I wasn't paid whatsoever, I realized that it is indeed a fake company. Anyways, I've learnt my lesson, I'm never going to go near an online job unless it's on a big trusted website like Upwork or Freelance.

After all that we get to her office and she tells me that I have to pay a fee for the site, I told her I don rsquo t have any money to pay, then she just goes and pays for it with her card which I felt that was forced upon me cause I didn rsquo t ask her to pay for it or even want to join the site, then she tells me write down all my debt card information and expire date, which I did.Then she tells me to get a blank cheque from my bank and drops me off at the CIBC, so I go and ask for one, the lady at the bank gives me a weird look and asks why, I try to explain to her and she rsquo s still confused as to why I need a blank cheque. So I get picked back up and I told Jess what happened, then she rsquo s like thats ok you rsquo ll pay me cash, and I questioned her again why I need to pay this fee, she said it rsquo s for the training and for the site but before all this she told me the training was free. Then they expect me to walk around all day and recruit people the same way she did to me without getting paid cause apparently I rsquo m my own business, is what they kept saying to me when I asked how do I make money from this company.

You will work from your home. Using your smartphone or laptop."" ""Bank account for work: During the trial period you may need to use your personal bank account. Your account will only be used during the trial period, after passing it you will be provided with a company account.""

They sent an e-mail directly and claimed to have found me on the job website ZipRecruiter, which I had been visiting daily.  The letter was well written and formal enough to sound real, so if you skim over your e-mails, you might miss important details. They also sent a Labour Agreement which stated, among other things: ""5) Disability: In the event that the Employee cannot perform the duties because of illness or incapacity for a period of more than 1 week, the compensation otherwise due during said illness or incapacity will be reduced by 50% percent. The Employee's full compensation will be reinstated upon return to work. However, if the Employee is absent from work for any reason for a continuous period of over 1 month, the Company may terminate the Employee's employment, and the Company's obligations under this agreement will cease on that date.""

Before the interview though, they offered me a full time position with quite a decent salary considering the only experience needed was high school. They said they would start me on a two week probation period, which I told them I couldn't start until the following Monday because I had to make arrangements with my current job first, which they said was fine. The next day, they phoned me four times, all of which went unanswered because i was at work, followed by two emails telling me they required me to start the next day, as their CEO was planning to come down the next week to finalize the office rental agreement. At this point I figured it had to be a scam of some sort, but decided to continue just to see what was going on.They sent me over an official looking contract which they had me fill out and sign, along with sending a picture of myself holding the signature. Now that brings us to my first day of training, in which they had me fill out a job posting and post it on an online board. That was simple enough. The next task was to post another job posting on an online board, except this time it was going to be paid. They explained that no money was to be coming out of my pocket, and that they'd transfer me the money in 2 or 3 installments so I could purchase bitcoin to post the job online. Obviously as soon as they requested my banking information I emailed them back saying I was no longer in need of employment, and deleted the job they had me post.

Also, I am going to supervise the whole process of your  gt  gt  gt  work.  gt  gt  gt  Becoming quite experienced, you will have to ordinarily manage 4-5  gt  gt  gt  clients at the same time.  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  There is the payment processing algorithm:  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  1. A client transfers money via Interac e-Transfer. We choose this  gt  gt  gt  method as of the highest security.  gt  gt  gt  All payments bear your fee of 5%. You will get your commission  gt  gt  gt  rewards  gt  gt  gt  for each transaction.  gt  gt  gt  For depositing funds, you will get a secret question and its  gt  answer.  gt  gt  gt  In  gt  gt  gt  order to deposit a processed transaction, you are entitled to apply  gt  gt  gt  online banking systems using them from any device (laptop / tablet  gt  /  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  smartphone).  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  2. Having finished depositing, you will be enabled to withdraw your  gt  gt  gt  funds through your bank office. We recommend you to avoid  gt  gt  gt  withdrawing  gt  gt  gt  money through ATMs as they usually have withdrawal limits  gt  gt  gt  ($250-$500),  gt  gt  gt  which may slow down the transaction processing.  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  3. Here, let me tell you how to process payments to our contractors  gt  gt  gt  quickly and securely. When accomplished the Step 2, please find the  gt  gt  gt  nearest Bitcoin ATM to process the transaction to our contractors'  gt  gt  gt  Bitcoin account.  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  Why Bitcoin?  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  We use Bitcoin due to several significant reasons:  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  1. Bitcoin is highly safe and secure. Among all online banking  gt  gt  gt  systems,  gt  gt  gt  Bitcoin account shows the greatest security level.  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  2. Bitcoin operation processing is truly fast. Making bank  gt  gt  gt  transfers,  gt  gt  gt  you generally have to have transactions pending for a few days -  gt  gt  gt  especially when you submit a check payment from another bank into  gt  gt  gt  yours,  gt  gt  gt  and the bank holds funds for verification. International  gt  gt  gt  transactions  gt  gt  gt  are also a time problem. This way, Bitcoin is much more efficient.  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  3. Bitcoin fees are extremely low, and sometimes you may get no  gt  gt  gt  commission at all.  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  a) The closest Bitcoin ATM is here:  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  2500 Hurontario St  gt  gt  gt  Mississauga, ON L5B 1N4  gt  gt  gt  Canada  gt  gt  gt  (Bitcoin ATM is installed at Number 1 Convenience in Mississauga.)  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt  gt  b) Please be guided by this video for processing Bitcoin ATM  gt  gt  gt  operations:  gt  gt  gt   gt  gt   gt  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRtrnNg svA amp list=PLXx3C EX8lSP9NjdbJKV4cu9CYR8gNb3y  gt  gt  gt  c) Open the QR-code attached to this message as an image.

They offered a high salary of 1340 (cad) a week, promising I would be paid weekly and I could work remotely. I googled them and google lists an address in Rexdale. Score, right? As I went through the process they offered me a legal-sounding contract, promised a 10 day trial period in which they would judge my work, and then wanted to e-transfer money to my bank account so that I could then put it in a Bitcoin wallet. A legitimate company is never going ask you to use your personal account for money transfers, and they could just as easily put the money in a Bitcoin wallet themselves. The money transfer was the proof I needed that the company wasn't on the up-and-up but there were details beforehand that made me suspicious: They sent detailed, well-written emails and had a nicely put together website that used a lot of words but wasn't clear about their services. None of the people listed as working at the company on their website were findable on social media which is strange and neither was the woman I was talking to. The date their company was founded when you look up their Corp. number (10522988) on can1business.com does not match with how long they say they have been in business on their website. On their website they listed articles that supposedly praised them as the top marketing firm in X year. I couldn't find those articles anywhere.

R2L 1B4,"Mar 28, 2018",Advanced Media Inc,"I responded to a part time job ad on Kijiji and when the person (Douglas Webb) responded to me he explained that the job was to post sponsored job ads on the website indeed.ca.  He explained that the pay would be $   /week or $   /bi-weekly or $$     /monthly and to let him know how I would like to be paid and that I had the option of money order or certified cheque.  He then explained they would provide me with an email address to create under yahoo, as I would need this address to register and create a login into the site indeed.ca.  He asked me to provide my name, mailing address, phone number for payment.  He said after creating this account with indeed.ca, he would send me a detailed directory needed for the posting, and that I would need to do these postings 2-3 times per week.  I asked if the pay had any deductions (tax), and if there would be a T4?  He replied that the tax was taken care of and that the money was all mine.  When I chose to be paid weekly by certified cheque, he then said they would be sending me a certified cheque in the amount of $     .  He said they were sending me extra money as I needed to use this money to purchase Itune gift cards and that this money also included weekly pay.  He asked me to purchase the gift cards from a WalMart near me but to provide the address of the Wal Mart to him that I would be purchasing them from.  I tried to call the number provided under his name a few times, but got voicemail each time. I said I would prefer to speak to someone directly about all of this and wanted him to phone me.  I then asked further questions on email, like how much of this was to be spent on Itune cards, and how much was weekly pay, and mentioned that something seemed ""off"" about this being legitimate.  I said you are trusting me to send me $    ?  How do you know I will do what you ask? This was the latest email I got back from him (note the weekly wage changed to $   /week  and the posting site change to Kijiji and now he is asking me to purchase the ITunes cards before I receive payment, saying I will be compensated): Thanks for getting back to us with the Wal Mart address as requested. Be rest assured this is 100% legit and you have no cause for alarm. Also You can get the Itunes cards purchased. You are just to purchase like $     worth of itunes card and it is only for this time. You will be receiving your weekly wages of $    steadily. We will let you know when to receive the payment and the instructions needed to process the prepaid card.While waiting for the payment to arrive, we would like you to post on kijiji. There will be a compensation for this as well. Let us know if this is OK by you so that we can send you the directory needed. We will await your reply asap in respect to this. I replied and said I would not be using any of my own money to purchase anything and said this felt like a scam to get me to purchase Itune gift cards (esp as he explains this $     purchase was a one time purchase - of course it is!  Cause then I would realize it was a scam!).  I also pointed out to him that he changed the wage amount and posting site to Kijiji (from Indeed.ca).","{'la': 49.907618, 'lo': -97.0968, 'rlo': -1.69465885315043, 'rla': 0.8710522559275871}",0.0

T5X 5E2,"Mar 23, 2018",Diamond Staffing Solutions Ltd. spoof,"I was contacted sight-unseen with a 'job offer' by Alice Williams of Diamond Staffing Solutions Ltd. in Vancouver, BC looking for a full-time, and a part-time Human Resources Specialist to work in their new office opening in Edmonton, Alberta.  The e-mail said (among other things), ""We have studied your resume and came to the conclusion that you will suit for this role.""  If you were to read my resume, you would know that I am not qualified for this position as I don't have the needed education for anything more than a clerical assistant in this particular field.  I will convert the job description they sent me to pdf, and attach it.  The salary being offered for the full-time position is $5000.00 per month, but the 10 day paid probation term only pays $700.00 total (which is below the minimum wage here in Alberta).  In all of the e-mails she uses grammatical errors common to non-native speakers.  My guess (having studied linguistics in school, and having a lot of exposure to immigrants having lived most of my life in Vancouver) is that she is from somewhere in SE Asia or from the Indian Sub-Continent.  The second e-mail followed the first very quickly (just over 2 hours later), and sounds more desperate for a quick reply.  The third asks me, ""If you want me to erase yours address from our mailing list, please let me know.""  The fourth e-mail says, ""I am going to erase your name from the mailing list and remove your name from the list of job candidate.""  I still have all four of the e-mails she sent me, and would be happy to forward them to you if desired. I suspect she must've posted a legitimate-looking job offer using a different (legitimate) company name on Linked In, which I applied to so that she could get my contact information.  I haven't used this contact information on indeed.ca, which I have used in the past, otherwise I'd wonder how she had come to have my new 'for job hunting only' e-mail address that I have only recently started using.  I had similar things happen in the past with indeed.ca.  The biggest difference is that Diamond Staffing Solutions has a website which features an address and telephone numbers, and it shows up on a web search.  The website almost looks legitimate, except for the poorly-executed logo. Needless to say, I have not replied to any of her e-mails, so I don't know what information or anything else she would have asked of me.  As it stands, she has my first and last name, job search e-mail address, and possibly my cell number. In any case, I'd appreciate your feedback, and any advice as to how to proceed.  I will definitely block her e-mail address in the near future unless you or legal authorities advise differently.

The email provided the details of the position and asked if I was still interested in the job.  I replied yes, they sent me documents to complete to do a ""security check"".  They explained they are an international company for international exchange students and I would be helping to set the students up for accommodations and provide general office duties.  The list of duties provided sounded normal.  They stated the office in London, Ontario was not open yet, it was scheduled to open in March 2018.  I would be expected to work remotely (from home) until the office opened.  I accepted the position and singed the documents.  I was instructed to sign onto an app called Telegram.  This would ensure I my hours were tracked.  I started to work on Friday Feb 9th 2018, I received my first project.  I was to create a PowerPoint presentation about London, Ontario.  The due date was Thurs Feb 14, 2018 at 5pm.  I competed the project on time and was told it was really good and they were happy with my work. The next day I received a new project.  I was to research accommodations for undergrad students coming to London, Ontario and staying for the summer months.  The due date was for Friday Feb 16, 2018 at 5pm.  On Friday I received a telegram message asking me to setup payment for accommodations for a group of students coming to Halifax NS and then to Ontario next week.  At this point I was suspicious.  So I asked a whole bunch of questions as to why they couldn't pay through the company account or credit card and why would they ask a new person to be handling money.  After I started to ask questions, the person stopped talking on Telegram.  So I finished my project and handed it in at 4:40pm.  I was told we would be working on Family Day, so I signed into Telegram this morning and Doris Holinaty is not online.  So I called her number, it is disconnected, as is another number used to call me.","{'la': 45.270516, 'lo': -66.061852, 'rlo': -1.152996827365201, 'rla': 0.790119558276773}",0.0

I am pleased to inform you that you have passed the most difficult stage of our employment. Congratulations! I'm very happy for you. I have always believed and knew that you will be in our team!

I decided to continue as i did not want to be judgy. Bod, then gave me my first task (which seem legit) i had to create a Job Ad on indeed, all was good till then. I was actually happy and excited to be doing work like that and from home! Reality sank in when he gave me my second task. He stated that the company used Bitcoin and proceed to tell me the following: ""I'll give you one Bitcoin account of our company. And I'll teach you how to use it. Of course, you will need some Bitcoins. We will provide you with funds for this reason. I'll help you buy Bitcoins. We need to be able to transfer money to you so that you can buy bitcoin for work.

I took a while to respond and twice he asked me if i was there and to keep in touch. I did some investigating and called the building where their office is supposed to be, according to their website and i was notified that they do not have an office there and they've had complaints about ""The Halifax Staffing Inc"" using their building address. I then proceeded to email Bod the Following: ""Unfortunately i won't be able to continue with the training. I apologize but i am not comfortable with this type of employment.

N2K 1S1,"Feb 03, 2018",EEInterculturalAffairs,"This lady named Caroline Dias uses Indeed.ca to find resumes, and offers people bogus work at a huge rate of pay, plus many promises such as increases, benefits and bonuses. She claims in an introductory email that EEIntercultural Affairs is opening an office ""in your city"" and is populating it with staff ahead of time. The opportunity is work-from-home at first. Duties are to create PowerPoint presentations about the area to ostensibly  be shown to foreign students. There is no face-to-face interview or meeting with anyone. I got the job in 3 days, and my references were not called. I investigated her phone number which GPS'd to Vancouver, not Winnipeg. When I pressed for executive tier and revenue  stream information, she didn't answer my Telegram texts and claimed their internet connection went down. After more digging, I found out from BBB that this is a scam before she tried to launder money through me. Her trick is to e-transfer $3000 to your email address that you are asked to take to a local contact of her choosing, less $100 for your expenses. Then she calls  your bank and tells them you tried to scam her, which will cause your bank to place a hold on your account. I found out about her before she  got that far, and all I lost was a week's pay from my former situation. You should always be wary if there is no interview, and requests for banking information.

T3J 0H1,"Feb 01, 2018",Digital idea,"I applied on job ad on indeed as customer service manager. Some one called me from New York called Arlie (business development manager) but I couldn rsquo t pick up the phone. So he sent me an email (came to my junk ) that I am accepted and I have to sign the job offer and payroll form which was asking for email to send money by e transfer. I did that and send them back to him . The day after, I received an email from my supposed manager (James Evans) that I have to be the person who will contact customers and contractors to deposit money from them and pay money to others using my bank account. I didn rsquo t feel comfortable with that and send them that NO and I declined the job . Here rsquo s the email content: There is the payment processing algorithm: 1. A client transfers money via Interac e-Transfer. We choose this method as of the highest security. All payments bear your fee of 5%. You will get your commission rewards for each transaction. For depositing funds, you will get a secret question and its answer. In order to deposit a processed transaction, you are entitled to apply online banking systems using them from any device (laptop / tablet / smartphone). 2. Having finished depositing, you will be enabled to withdraw your funds through your bank office. We recommend you to avoid withdrawing money through ATMs as they usually have withdrawal limits ($250-$500), which may slow down the transaction processing. 3. Here, let me tell you how to process payments to our contractors quickly and securely. When accomplished the Step 2, please find the nearest Bitcoin ATM to process the transaction to our contractors' Bitcoin account. Why Bitcoin? We use Bitcoin due to several significant reasons: 1. Bitcoin is highly safe and secure. Among all online banking systems, Bitcoin account shows the greatest security level. 2. Bitcoin operation processing is truly fast. Making bank transfers, you generally have to have transactions pending for a few days - especially when you submit a check payment from another bank into yours, and the bank holds funds for verification. International transactions are also a time problem. This way, Bitcoin is much more efficient. 3. Bitcoin fees are extremely low, and sometimes you may get no commission at all. a) The closest Bitcoin ATM is here: 216 Saddletowne Cir NE Calgary, AB T3J 0C9 Canada (Bitcoin ATM is located at Jerry's Convenience Store in Calgary.) b) Please be guided by this video for processing Bitcoin ATM operations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9-xP2CBWj0 c) Open the QR-code attached to this message as an image. This is the unique ID for your payment. Please save it to the media library of your cell phone in advance. 4. The transaction shall be processed within no longer than 3 hours. Bitcoin rate is highly volatile related to CAD, USD and others. Therefore, the transaction shall be accomplished within the abovementioned time period.","{'la': 51.123329, 'lo': -113.941691, 'rlo': -1.98865766323999, 'rla': 0.8922704156303001}",0.0

They send you emails constantly, showing them living their fabulous lifestyles but the truth is, they move to countries like indonesia because it's cheaper to live down there and there's probably some legal/illegal reasons too but i don't know those.

She sent an attachment of the job offer and asked for a confirmation either accepting or declining the offer, but also to provide my email and phone number. Which is strange because I thought she would have my resume if she's giving me a job offer. A day later, I get another email and this time it has two attachments: employment registration and employment agreement  which seemed legitimate enough. Unfortunately for them, that wasn't enough for me. I wanted to research the company, follow any clues they gave me that verified that their company existed. All I had was their website, it also looks legit but the: reviews, contacts, terms  amp  conditions and Privacy Policies didn't make sense. They stated they're affiliated with the Government of Canada and Educational System, why is there no evidence of affiliations showing? When I called the ""company"", the same number is the on the website and the email she gave me, she stated, ""that the company website is being updated and that everything about them should show up in a few days."" Can you believe that? SHE TOLD ME TO CHECK UP ON THEM IN A FEW DAYS, then you'll find them everywhere on any search engine. Anyways, I asked her to provide the documents she has on my myself since she's giving me the job offer and I haven't heard back, I dont expect to hear back but I plan to report this anyways.","{'la': 43.729461, 'lo': -79.276651, 'rlo': -1.383638579904455, 'rla': 0.7632230745724521}",0.0

I was in a class during the time they called and tried to call back but no one answered.  After answering interview questions over email, the hiring manager answered me to inform me that I had been selected to work as an administrative assistant for their new company opening in Vancouver.  He told me that their accounting team would be mailing me a cheque for office supplies and I was to contact them ""as soon as the money was credited to my account"" and asked me to send him a copy of the deposit slip, which I did.  I was very naive and didn't consider that it was a scam!  Thankfully, my bank manager called me early the next day to inform me that the cheque was a scam and that I should contact VPD immediately.  Thanks to my bank, they caught it in time and I wasn't shorted money, and the scammer wasn't given any.  For the next three days I had panic attacks and nausea- it was a really upsetting experience for me.  I'm not very hesitant to use sites like Craigslist for job seeking.

This person told me that I'd applied and they wanted to offer me the job, but I had never heard of this company. Mind you, I'd been job hunting for months and was losing track of where I'd applied, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I couldn't find any information on the company  they seemed nonexistent (apart from their website that did in fact have job listings). This person was very persistent, and despite me asking questions about what the job would entail, they gave me very little information about what my job duties would actually include. First my title would be Human Resource Specialist, then on the ""Freelance Agreement"" they sent me it said Job Recruiter. They didn't speak English very well which was odd, you'd think someone in their position at an actual agency would have decent grammar. And the salary they were offering was overly generous for very minimal, stay at home work. It didn't make sense. What fooled me was that contract. I read it over a handful of times, and it seemed legitimate. Looking back, they could've copy and pasted it from anywhere and had me sign it. But I was desperate after job hunting for so long, and was intrigued by the possibility of actually making decent money with minimal experience. My judgement went out the window. What has my stomach in knots now, is they also wanted photo ID. So I took a picture of my driver's license (I blurred out my license number and address) and sent it to them. They now have my full name, photo ID, date of birth and postal code. All basic private information to get into private accounts, and god knows what else.

Mostly Europe or America and mentioned nothing about Canada. I received the payment and was repeatedly called and messaged to be updated about what was going on with the funds.

I failed to do so and was asked to e-transfer it back to her. 3 days later was supposedly my ""pay day"" from this company and the woman named Stefania Paolini stopped responding through the telegram app as well as my phone calls.

His English was very poor and it all started to look like a scam. I googled the employer and found nothing. The only way to see a website on the employer was a direct link on the email I received.

The email was vague about what the job entailed, but I was curious as I am in search of employment, so I responded with the job application form they included, despite my concern about the Word document she sent me, which was not professional and contained too many grammatical errors.  I also had an electronic signature on it, that was illegible, but no name was printed, just a title.  The job application did not ask for any seriously personal info that they would not have already seen from the employment website       , so I proceeded with the application.  I did conduct my own research, I         nbsp the company which brought me to a very basic website, again not describing in detail what they do, there were no links, no terms of services, and the phone number that was not local or even a 1-800 number, it was strange.  I then         nbsp the person who contacted me Ashley Lawrence, which I was unable to find anywhere, a          nbsp profile, etc.  The address listed on the website for this ""business"" is also a residential apartment building.  I received another email from Ashley saying they are welcoming me to the position, I replied asking a few more questions about the job, the company location and if I could speak to Ashley on the phone or meet her in person.  I was told that she only corresponds via email, again the email was full of grammatical errors and not professional, like a business should be, she also did not answer any of my questions/concerns.  She sent me another Word document, which was a Contract for Employment, this one was just as full of grammatical errors, nor professional on any sort of company template, it also had a new name on the form which was Hooman Tobari.  I tried to find if this company was incorporated like they claimed and was unable to find anything on any of the government websites for incorporated (legal) companies.  The emails were vague, very sketchy and unwilling to answer my questions or speak on the phone.  I also researched their ""testimonials"" that were on the website and these people do not exist, except for one which is in Australia.  I have included the two Word documents (converted to PDF for uploading purposes here) that were sent to me.

I provided my ID. Then I was told that I was hired but had to purchase a $50 ""Steem Wallet Gift Card"" or itunes card because that would activate the time tracker if I was hired. I purchased a $50 itunes card then gave her the number. She immediately informed me the card was invalid. I had just purchased it so I knew it would be working. I said I would call itune support to find out. In the mean time she told me that it's probably because someone scammed it and I should return to the store to complain and get another card to proceed with interview. I said I couldn't afford it. She then asked if I had a credit card. I said no, she then asked what my bank info was. I replied that I wasn't comfortable giving that out. I asked if we could proceed without the card for now, she replied it would violate policy unless I have at least a $25 itunes card. She then informed me my chance of getting the job was now low because the company was looking for dedicated freelancers who would create an idea during emergency and that they would need to check my credit score since I don't have a credit card. I finished speaking with apple who informed me to make a police report because 30 minutes after I purchased the card, it was redeemed (which was the same time she was trying validate it). I informed her I was making a police report and she said that it was bullshit that I didn't call apple. I then informed her that I believe I was scammed and she asked what proof did I have. I didn't respond. I should have known better, I know that you NEVER have to give any money up front to get a job, but I didn't think itunes would also be a part of it.

Here is some detailed information about them: Scamming since: March-April 2017. Company name: North Park Education Community. Website: http://www.npecommunity.com/ Websites purchased from: http://www.namecheap.com, where you can own a website for $0.48/year. Web-Analyzer that shows the company's TRUE information  http://wa-com.com/npecommunity.com Names that the scammers go by: Samantha Fenton, Fernando Villanueva. Phone numbers they use: Samantha:1-306-700-5597, Fernando: 1-306-229-5955. Toll Free number at 1-888-788-6393. The phone numbers appear to be from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, but the scammers actually route phone numbers to make them seem like the numbers came from Saskatchewan. The actual phone call is made from San Francisco, California in the United States. Apps required to communicate with the scammer: Telegram woman scammer's username:@samanthafNPEC Fake Location: 1) 230 22nd St E. Ste 205 Saskatoon, SK S7K 0E8. 2) Piazza Fortebraccio 4, 2th floor Perugia, 06123 Italy  They claim their company is located inside a building. But as you can probably predict, the building exists, but their fake scam company doesn't exist. Method they use: If you applied for a lot of jobs in Indeed.com, chances are, you might have applied for their scam company. They will contact you saying that they have read your resume and are interested in hiring you. They will explain that their office is located in Saskatoon, SK, but they are going to expand their office to your city, and they need admins as soon as possible. They claim that until they find a suitable office in your city next month, you will work at home. After you talk to them, they will send you a PDF file of job descriptions where they discuss the nature of the job,  high pay, benefits, bonuses, etc. If you accept the job, they will give you an Employment agreement form and Registration form where you will be required to fill out your name, address, education, and references and sign a bunch of agreements. Then she will tell you that the security check will take 1-2 business days. After 1-2 business days, she will contact you (phone call and/or email) saying you passed the security check, and that now you are on a probation with the company. She will ask you to download a mobile/PC app called ""Telegram"" which is a Russian app version of Hangout app. Then she gives you an Account Form, where you fill out your bank direct deposit information. From that day and after, she repeatedly assigns you projects which are easy but super time-consuming to complete and gives you 2-3 days to finish them. The nature of the projects is regarding your city, events, hotels, post secondary education, etc: Length varies but it is long. If they didn't scam you earlier with all your personal information and bank information, they will try to scam you 1-2 weeks after. This is as far as I got  As soon as I realized I was working for a scam company, I changed my bank information and put a fraud alert on my credit by contacting banks, TransUnion, and Equifax. The woman scammer tried to use my bank information and nothing went through. Then the woman scammer called me again for my bank information, and I gave the woman a computer virus and        up one of her computers. She pretended that nothing happened and asked for my bank information again(...? Yes, she is pretty dumb). I gave her another virus, which she didn't open and said the file was virus. Then she kept asking for my bank information, and I just trolled her. Now she blocked me from the Telegram App and her email address.","{'la': 51.04918, 'lo': -114.078645, 'rlo': -1.991047961463766, 'rla': 0.8909762714432381}",0.0

This is supposedly an ON company trying to expand in Calgary. There is no company address on his email but a link to their site.

Not knowing, I did give my name and address and I received a cheque for way more than is needed for basic office supplies. I got surprised by the amount that I received but I was even more surprised to read a quick instruction that came with the cheque, asking me to deposit this big amount to an ATM machine only so that the funds are not being held at the bank and so that I can use it instantly. Banking system says opposite. depositing a big amount cheque from an unknown payor will be held for 3-5 business days in order to be verified. While being surprised still, I took the cheque to the counter and asked if I can deposit it to my account. That's when I found out that this is a scam. The teller did a great job of identifying it as scam and told me that she has to talk to her manager about it immediately. Soon enough, the manager came to me and asked me how I received the cheque. I explained and the manager confirmed it is part of a scam. However, to be certain the manager forwarded the letter and the cheque to their compliance department for more attestation.

After sending me a number of forms to fill out, none of which asked about my abilities to complete the ""tasks"" that were supposedly going to pay me 67000 dollars a year. I was suspicious at first, however proceeded with caution until I was absolutely sure. Throughout the emails exchanged I noticed there were a number of grammar mistakes that were abnormal for a reputable company. I checked the website, it seemed ""legit"" however did not provide me with much more information about the company as everything was very vague. Finally, once I was ""accepted"" over many applicants (I did not even apply), I was told I would have a personal bitcoin account to handle business and would be sent an interact email transfer, and in order to do that I would have to give the account holders name (me), my bank institution, and my email address. This I immediately found strange because first of all, for interact transfers my name is not really necessary, nor is the name of where I bank. On top of that, they already had my email address? So I emailed Mr. Halstead back, replying that it seemed a little strange and I would like to speak to somebody over the phone. He replied back soon enough saying his manager would call me, but also saying welcome to the team... and he didn't really directly answer any of my questions which was also a red flag for me. Finally I received a phone call from the number listed on their website as their ""Markham, Ontario"" location. It was also the same number on ""Kevin Halstead's"" email stamp. However, the phone call was not from him, but from a lady who spoke poor english.  She began to describe to me exactly what the email had said when it was describing my tasks. She said that she was the ""iterator"" and that I would need to send another email if I requested more information about the legitimacy of the company. She said I could speak with a manager if I would like to, however the email said I would receive an email from the manager so I questioned her on that as well. She began to get nervous, and finally when I asked her what her name was she responded ""Tiffany"" and then proceeded to spell Tiffany for me. This lady on the phone had a thick accent and it was obvious to me her name was not Tiffany. When I asked her last name, she paused for a moment and then said ""Smith"".

They got back to me a few days later, inviting me to an interview on google hangouts the next morning. The interview itself seemed fine but after it was over, they said they had to go over my answers to proceed. After about 45 minutes, they told me I was hired and training would start the next day. The next day, the person I was chatting with asked me two questions and answered two questions I had Amongst other things, they told me that while the company was American, they plan to open an office in Canada within 6 months. It took about 50 minutes all in all, because the person had to refer to specific departments in the company for answers. The day after that, we met online again, same time. He asked me to sign the employee contract he'd send me, which I did. I was now an 'official employee of Equian'. Note that he had so far not asked me for my social insurance number or bank information, other than which bank I am with. A day later, they told me they send me a cheque so I could buy some office supplies. Three days later the cheque arrived. As I was not home, I found it on my front step. It seemed kind of strange to me that they would send me money and then  not make me sign for receiving it. I opened the envelope and in it was a rather large cheque ($2,750). It seemed like a lot to me. I also noted that the company on the envelope wasn't Equian but Forever Green Intl. The company name on the cheque was yet another name: Dreamtec Global Inc. So I had three different company names for this one job I was supposed to have. As soon as I told the persons I got the cheque, he asked me how far away my bank is, where the nearest atm would be, how long it would take for the money to be deposited into my account. I got suspicious after I told him I could deposit it with online banking and he had to talk to the accounting department whether that was acceptible. At this point, I decided to go to the bank to make sure it was legit. My personal bank told me almost right away that it looked like a fraudulent cheque. They contacted the bank on the cheque to ask for information on the company that was on the cheque. As they were waiting to hear back, I went to the bank mentioned on the cheque. They said the bank didn't know they company and that I could either send the cheque back or rip it up. The police (where we went after all this) informed us that we could make a report online, but that they wouldn't be able to do much, because that's just the nature of scammers.

I signed my name on it, and sent it back. After this ""Emilie"" stopped responding. I noticed that the signature at the bottom of the Labour Agreement was for ""John Krasner"", but the actual signature looked nothing like that, it looked like it started with an H and had an L in it. So I got suspicious and started researching the company. Googled the address, and a bunch of different companies all list 5700 Yonge St #200, North York ON M2M 4K2 as their address. For example: Yorkey-Investigations Inc., DocsBase Certified Translation Agency, ADR Mediation Network, Ease  amp  Strength Massage, Location of Life Pathways Psychotherapy, etc. and a lot more. I couldn't find anyone by the name of Emilie Burns or John Krasner that had anything to do with the company. The company has no social media pages. It seems to be owned by Seyed Ali Mirabolghasemi. The company website www.futurewebmedia.inc shows that they have another location in Australia. Locaton : 95 Murray st, Perth, WA 6001 Australia. I googled Future Web Media Inc. to see when/if it was registered and this came up, with an address that doesn't match:  ""The Future Web Media Inc. was incorporated on Monday 17th May 2010, so the company age is six years and seven months. The company registration status is Active.Future Web Media Inc. register address is 7368 Yonge St., Suite#: 311, Thornhill (area code: L4J8H9) . The company's country of origin is CA. ""  I figured it was a scam so I e-mailed ""Emilie"" and told her the address she gave me doesn't match the search results on google. She responded:  ""It's our address.  Congratulations! You have accepted for a trial period on the Online Service manager position.  We have chosen you out of a certain number of candidates for this position, and we hope that you will not let us down.  You are familiar with your responsibilities and ready to get to work.  You should check your e-mail constantly and respond to my messages quickly.  Just keep your cell phone available to get a call from us at all times.  Many organizations are required to produce accounting documents about their activity. Using Bitcoin allows you to offer  the highest level of transparency since you can provide information your members can use to verify your balances and transactions.  Bitcoin is an emerging market of new customers who are searching for ways to spend their bitcoins. Accepting them is a good way  to get new customers and give your business some new visibility. Accepting a new payment method has often shown to be a clever  practice for online businesses.  To start working with Bitcoin, you need to fill up your wallet. We will give you money via Interac system.  To do this, we need to know:  Your Holder name:  Your Bank branch name:  Your Email address associated with account:  Your phone number:  There is no fee to receive bitcoins, and many wallets let you control how large a fee to pay when spending.  Most wallets have reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster confirmation of your transactions.  Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it's possible to send 100,000 bitcoins for the same fee it costs to send 1 bitcoin.  After receiving electronic transfer, you will have to fill up your Bitcoin wallet. (DURING AN HOUR AND A HALF)  We will send you 2-3 transactions through Interac system.  Have you ever used electronic transfer (Interac)?  Do you have online banking active?  Your duty will be to:  - Contact the customer   - Take his order   - Analyze order   - Contact the seller (our partner)   - Report the order value to the customer.  After that you will contact with the customer and give him all the details of his order.  (Including delivery time in client's region).  You must ensure all necessary tasks for the client. You should find an individual approach to each customer.  You should offer new services and products to him.  In other words, your position requires you to do everything possible, to make client happy.  For the future, he will work with us and recommend our company to others.  You need to understand your customer, how to do it:  Providing a high level of customer care often requires you to find out what your customers want.  Once you have identified your most valuable customers or best potential customers,  you can target your highest levels of customer care towards them.  You should collect information about your customer.  Information about your customer and what he wants is available from many sources, including:  - His order history  - Records of their contacts with our business - phone calls, meetings and so on  - Direct feedback - if you ask them, customers will usually tell you what they want  - Changes in the overall success of specific products or services  - Feedback about your existing range - what it does and does not do  - Inquiries about possible new products or services  - Feedback from your customers about things they buy from other businesses  - Feedback and referrals from other, non-competitive suppliers.  It may sound hard, and sometimes it is not clear to you. Do not worry, I'll be in charge of  you throughout the 10 days. I will give detailed instructions step by step. So after the trial 10 days,  you will learn this profession, if you will work hard.  !You should answer all the questions that I have written in this letter (highlighted in green).  After that, I will send your personal Bitcoin wallet to you.  If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask me. I will answer.  Thank you!

Car wrap advertising is the marketing practice of completely or partially covering a vehicle with an advertisement or livery, thus turning it into a mobile billboard. This can be achieved by simply painting the vehicle surface, but it is becoming more common and professional today to use large vinyl sheets as decals.  It can be removed with relative ease, making it much less expensive to change from one advertisement to another. Vehicles with large, flat surfaces, such as Truck, SUV, and Sedan are easy to work with, though smaller cars with curved surfaces can also be wrapped in this manner. Wrap advertising is available to anybody irrespective of the vehicle you drive, mileage, make and model of your car .  You car mileage does not stop you from registering for this program. We are currently seeking to contract individuals in Canada and USA on how they would make extra cash by simply driving their cars wrapped with our company advert along the streets of Canada. LEARN HOW CAR ADVERTISEMENT PROGRAM WORKS:- It is very important and imperative for you to get a better understanding about this program. Here's the basic premise of the  ldquo pay to drive rdquo  concept: We seek residents in Canada and USA, who drive while going about their daily lives activities with an advert from  ldquo our Company rdquo  plastered on their cars side door or rear glass. This advert size is relatively designed in different portions. The ads are typically vinyl decals material, also known as ""auto wraps,"" that almost seem to be painted on the vehicle, and covers a little portion of your car's exterior surface. PROGRAMM TIME FRAME:- After registration, processing and approval stage is done with and  the wrap has been installed, minimum duration is 20 weeks and maximum is 40 weeks.  If after the first 20 or 40 weeks you want to continue this program, we can re-register or reapprove you for another 20 or 40 weeks as you desire. THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT DAMAGES:- New technology age has brought lots of improvement in terms of research, production and installation process to lots of products. The decal wrap doesn't damage the paint of any car. We have the latest tech materials suitable with various kinds of our yearly weather.  This new tech will be installed and removed by our approved wrap expert once the contract is approved or when it expires. PROFESSIONAL INSTALLERS:- We will not take chances with anyone or any local installer to do the wrapping as your vehicle is precious to us and we require a standard and attractive ad, so we will be responsible for installation and removal of the wrap to avoid any sort of damages to you vehicle but should anything occur we will fully be responsible for any damages. You will be paid $325.00 per week which is essentially a  ldquo rental rdquo  payment for letting our company use the space and no fee of any sort is required from you. You will not be responsible for any payment or any out of pocket expenses. We shall provide experts that would handle the advert placing on your car. You will receive an upfront payment of $650.00 in form of a check via courier service or regular mail to cover your first and second week payment plus any other expenses if need be. IMPORTANT NOTICE:- We will provide professionals strictly to come to your residence for installation and removal of the decal so as to avoid damage on your vehicle. Also you are NOT required to pay any fee from your own pocket. However, to enable us complete the registration process and approval, you are to provide us with the information below  Full Name: Address: Apt#: CITY: PROVINCE: POSTAL CODE: AGE: MOBILE PHONE: HOME PHONE: EMAIL: OCCUPATION: POSITION: NUMBER OF CARS: TYPE OF CAR(S): MODERN / YEAR: CAR COLOR: PRESENT MILEAGE: WRAP DURATION: NAME ON CAR REGISTRATION DOCUMENT: Attached is a sample of the car wrap for your review / perusal to enable you better understand how the ad might look on your car.

Thereafter, the date for your car wrap will be scheduled so the company can send their wrap specialist to your resident or office location for installation.

I found that this company had a company profile on the Government of Canada's website (which has now since been removed thanks to myself notifying them). Tapp Consulting Services required a scanned copy of an I.D. (passport, driver's license, or health card) before employment officially started. I scanned them a copy of my health card to them and they gave me my first job task. I emailed the ""senior manager"" there saying how I wanted to terminate my employment since I didn't know too much about the company. I did not hear back from them after this point.

Before committing to this, I asked about the territory I would have and about how they determined it was a viable area for a new magazine. I asked for contact information for other publishers in NS, or in Canada to discuss the opportunity in detail. They said they were going to get back to me with some real tangibles (territory, other publishers, etc),  but now have stopped communicating with me. I am concerned that they will get people to training, do a ""pitch"" and in the end offer no real ""employment"".

I said I was interested in the job and got a call asking simple questions including if I had been employed before. After the call, I got another email with a contract I had to fill out and send back and that I had two days to comply or else they wouldn't hire me as an employee. They called each job a ""task"" and said before I would be payed I had to complete a test task. The test task was to visit a Bitcoin ATM and check to see if it worked, what condition the machine was in, and if there were instructions on how to use it. I sent back my report on the machine and was told that I would start work the next day. The first job was to receive $1455 to my bank account and cash out $1380 of it, put that money into the Bitcion machine I visited the day before, and fill out another report form. The remaining $75 was to be my commission for completing the task. I did what they asked, sent in my report, and waited to hear about what task I would be doing next. They sent me a job to go to another Bitcoin ATM and do the same thing there. I told them that I would not cash out over $1000 twice in one day and they said they would send me the $1000 and cash out $920 for the remaining $80 was to be my commission. There was an error with the money transfer to my bank account and alerted them of the problem and was told they would fix it. I didn't hear from them until the next day and was told to send them my bank card number to complete the money transfer. I replied that I was not sending them my card number as the account number should be more than enough. They insisted they needed it as the task was to be completed that day. I asked to be sent another task to do and was denied as the other task had been given to someone else and that I would have more tasks the next day. They never contacted me again. I sent them emails for a couple days asking if there were any jobs to do. Still no reply. I then looked up to see if this was a regular thing and turned out it wasn't and that they were trying to scam me.

T3L ,"Sep 12, 2016",Retec Consulting,"I got an email from a certain              as a response to my LinkedIn resume and that they are interested to set up an interview. I was excited as the opportunity was a dream($4800 per mo plus benefits) so I replied saying I am interested and they sent me a survey with only 3 easy questions. I was more excited when I was told that they picked me for the job and that I am to start on Sept 26 but I will be working from home prior to that and they will send a laptop and a cheque to cover accommodations and supplies to use for the opening. I started to get wary about the job when I couldn't find any other info about Retec, only on what says on their website. I even asked my previous employer if he got a phonecall for references from this company and was told no. The Employment Confirmation looks legit and believable so I went ahead and told them I accept the job. I got a phonecall from '    ' (            ) saying I have to send my name, address and cellphone# so they can send the laptop and cheque. And they are also sending an agent to meet with me so we can go over the job and he will bring me to the new office. Sept 9 was when I got the Job Offer letter with more details. The most obvious question I noticed was the salary says US$1250 per week and the Director's name written was                 but the one signed for it is a certain '                '. I called              to ask him about it but was told to send an email for all questions so I did. After I found the BBB story dated Sep 8 about the scam, I called our local police thinking they can use the info that I have as a lead on maybe catching these scammers but I was told they can't do anything as there's no money involved. I got another email from them today asking for me to sign and send the job offer letter and that I have to confirm whether I can meet the agent on Sept 22 or Sept 23. I still haven't reply.

K2P 1A5,"Sep 08, 2016",Retec Consulting,"Hello, I rsquo d like to report a job scam. I rsquo ve been applying for jobs actively and I recently received an email from a Mr.              (likely a fake name) from a fake company named Retec Consulting. The email said that they obtained my CV on LinkedIn and would be calling me about an interview. I later received a phone call (voicemail) saying that I had been fast-tracked and would be sent an email survey to fill out, then would be contacted for an interview if I was qualified. I received the email survey and filled it out and forwarded it on. A couple days later I received an email saying I had been hired  no interview necessary as they suddenly  ldquo believe interviews do not guarantee success on the job rdquo . Naturally, I was excited at first, but then after some consideration, it just was not adding up. I did some sleuthing and confirmed that this was most likely a job scam, so I sent the following email to see what kind of response I would get. It explains some of the discrepancies I found. I hadn rsquo t mentioned the fact that $4800 a month seemed a little steep for an admin position- this was one of the things that sent a red flag flying. Good morning, I would first off like to extend my gratitude for this opportunity you have presented me. I do, however, have a few questions and concerns. I am currently employed and will not be able to accept this job offer without some clarification  I have heard of a lot of job scams going around lately, so I just wanted to clarify a few things, which I hope you can understand. First, would we be able to set up an in person interview? I know the job offer stated  ldquo We do believe that interviews do not guarantee success on the job rdquo , however it would alleviate some concerns that I have, which as a reputable employer, I rsquo m sure you could understand. Typically, some form of interview is done, as well references are usually asked for. I feel an interview is important to get a better understanding of the company that I would be working for, the job that I would be doing, and of the people that I would be working with. Also, I never directly applied to this position and went to search on LinkedIn for the Retec profile and Mr.              and could not find either anywhere, so I am just a little confused at how you accessed my CV/profile, as you had stated in emails, LinkedIn is where you obtained it from. Also, the documents you rsquo ve sent me say to email hr@retecconsult.com, however I am receiving all of these emails from hr@reteconsult.com- which is one  lsquo c rsquo  short. I tried googling your location (1368 Ouellette Ave, Windsor, ON N8X 1J9) and this company is not coming up under this address, as well there is no address indicated for the new Ottawa office. Finally, these red flags made me search under the Better Business Bureau and I was unable to find your business anywhere hellip  Please understand that I am just taking the necessary precautionary steps for addressing my concerns about legitimacy, as a few of these things are what job searchers are told to look out for as a  ldquo phishing scam rdquo  when in the midst of applying for jobs. I hope you can understand my predicament. I look forward to hearing back from you. I later called the number on their website and it described nothing of the company and just said  ldquo hold while we transfer you to a representative rdquo , then I was dropped to the voicemail. I noticed the building they claimed to be in had other suites/businesses in it, so I called the  ldquo                                            rdquo  and asked if they knew if this supposed business was located in the building. The woman said that she received 4 calls already about this and that one woman actually came into the building looking for it and that, no, it did not exist. This is what 100% confirmed to me that this was a phishing scam. Luckily for me, they received no information other than my name, email, and phone number. No credit card numbers/SIN number was handed out, so I rsquo m assuming they will be unable to access anything they were looking for. Please advise me if I am at risk for something that I may be missing? I will forward all the emails that were sent to/from upon your request. The website/email/phone numbers are below. I also have reason to believe the website is part of the scam, as I stated previously, it does not look like this business even exists. http://www.retecconsult.com/ hr@reteconsult.com (is the email  ldquo Bishop Brown rdquo  was sending emails from) hr@retecconsult.com (is the email on the website and the one that was indicated in the documents they forwarded me) 1-226-246-4613 is the phone number that called my cell and a woman left a voicemail on (all other phone # rsquo s in this area of Windsor seem to start with the area code 519- as per my call to the                                             rdquo ). Also the phone number on the website is different. Please feel free to email questions for any clarification/ more details that may be needed. Also, the emails may have some more details in them that you may need, so again, I will forward them upon request. And again, please email me if you believe I should be any further concerned about anything that may have transcribed. Thanks and have a great day!","{'la': 45.411296, 'lo': -75.694455, 'rlo': -1.321117465252684, 'rla': 0.79257663279773}",0.0

He hasn't told me a location for an interview, nor a time (just Monday or Tuesday, that's all). I have never had an employer ask me to show them my ID before coming to a job interview.

You will not be dealing directly with customers, during the probationary period, I will teach you to use Bitcoin. I will be your companion for a trial period, after I teach you everything you can assemble your own team as well as I connect you to our community through the Internet. You will not be left alone to work around you are people with whom you'll work and interact. Because of the growing popularity of Bitcoin and its significant advantages over other currencies, we came to the conclusion that it is better to keep some part of our assets in cryptocurrency. Why do we choose Bitcoin: 1. Zero or very low commission 2.24 hours / 7 days a week / 365 a year 3. Instant transfers 4. Safety, reliability, security, 5. Getting rid of intermediaries, such as correspondent banks 6. Ability to send microtransactions 7. Easy sending and receiving donations 8. Ability to bypass any sanctions 9. Complete control over your funds 10. Control means, where necessary According to this when you finish the trial period and to start substantive work, you'll need to be able to use Bitcoin. Our customers will pay for our work and service that we have them, then we will pay income taxes, and buy Bitcoin. During the probationary period, I will teach you everything you need to use. During the trial period, we teach you how to buy Bitcoin and operations with them. We will allocate you the money from our accounts, you buy them Bitcoin for our own company. It is not difficult, but we must be sure that you can handle it. This will be one of the main target for during the trial period.

T5Z 1W9,"Jul 26, 2016",DYNAMARK GROUP," Received an e-mail from a Jack Jones to say that I had replied to their ad on indeed.ca, for an Executive Service Manager position. According to the website that was provided, the company is in Baltimore, MD. Below, is the job description and application form: nbsp       Position: 			Executive Service Manager Hours(Full-Time):		9 a.m.  ndash  5 p.m. Salary(Full-Time):		826 CAD /per week + 5% for every completed order. Hours(Part-Time): 		25/week (flexible working hours) Salary(Part-Time):		461 CAD /per week + 5% for every completed order. Probationary Period:	5 business days  only 5% for every completed order. During the probation 5 days you will only be getting the commissionable based job. Then you will be getting the 826 CAD (full time) or 461 CAD (part time) salary + 5% for every completed order. (You'll have a salary weekly, direct deposit or check.) Benefits: Full Training Health and Dental Insurance 25 days of holiday, plus bank holidays and your birthday off each year Growing opportunities Flexible Working-hours Brand smartphone for work with internet access (iPhone or Android device) Phone Interview: according to the rules of our company you will have a phone interview after completing the required documents. Job Type: home based, full-time or part-time. You can easily combine it with any other job you have. You must have access to the internet from your PC/laptop and you can start working with us. Training: we provide a probationary period with support. All necessary training you will receive from your personal manager. Important: Bank account for work: During the probation period you may need to use your personal bank account. Your account will only be used during the probation period, after passing it you will be provided with a company account. It is inconvenient to open a new business account for every person that has not yet passed the probation period. Our company will be fully responsible for every transaction that will be made during the probation period. General Purpose: Perform clerical tasks related to the efficient maintenance and processing of transactions from customers. To become an Executive Service Manager you must have good organizational skills and be able to work under deadline pressure. All of the job that is ahead of you is according Canadian  Employment Standards code RSA 2000. Scheme of Work: 1. Accompany sales: Prepare, verify, and process payments  2. Verify that transactions comply with financial policies and procedures  3. Transfer money to headquarters/branch  4. Keeping accurate records of operations. What exactly you will have to do: Receive and transfer transactions from our customers and clients for the services that they purchase at our stores. For the Executive Service Manager this means using the online transfer institutions. All necessary information will be given to you after passing the employment election process. Job activities: We sometimes have customers that owe us funds and pay us in financial institutes cashable only in the local area. Since we work all over the world, it is much easier for our customers to transfer money to our Executive Service Manager who are in the same area. After receiving the funds Executive Service Manager must record information about the transfer and report. Then send money to one of our branches or agents. Why do we need Executive Service Manager? 1. Reduces % of taxes (avoiding double taxation.)  2. Reduces expenses for offices maintenance (as Executive Service Manager is an official company's representative, so the servicing of offices is not required.)  3. Number of clients has increased (many customers can not make an international money transfer.)  4. Our service has increased (as the international transfer needs about 5 days to reach our official local office and then a couple of days to reach the performers branch. Consequently, it slows down our work significantly. It would be much faster if Executive Service Manager receives the money and directs them to the appropriate department/branch.)  5. Improves quality of reporting (each Executive Service Manager is responsible for one's region. That system allows us to quickly and accurately make up all the reports and avoid their mess up.)

But because as Mr Neyer puts it: ""The position is very  competitive, so the sooner you begin the first stage of the probationary period, the more chances you have to be selected for the position."" He then went on to say, ""I would recommend you to begin the probationary period this week."" 4, But I had to fill out a 2nd application called ""The Probationary Employment Agreement"" which asked for my bank information. 5.

The ""recruiter"" claimed his name was Gary White. Gary sent me e-mails indicating I had been given the ""job"" and that he was to send me a starting bonus as well as money to purchase a laptop and office supplies.  I had e-mailed him asking several questions about the business and did not get any responses to my e-mails. He then started texting me asking if I had received the e-mails. 3 days later he mailed a check (not certified) by registered mail to my address. As soon as he realized the envelope was received (due to it being registered) he was in constant contact by email asking if I had followed the instructions in regards to depositing the check he had sent so that I would use the funds to ""purchase the laptop"" and ""business supplies"". I had a feeling this was a scam since the beginning, however now this was abundantly clear as the check for $2,400 was not certified, nor did the ""business"" information match the so called ""consulting business"" he operated as an entrepreneur. The check itself was apparently issued by an international bank called ICICI BANK CANADA located in Scarborough, Ontario. The check was issued from a supposed company called ""Amen Gospel Media"". This had nothing to do with the so-called ""consulting firm"" that Gary White owned and operated.  All of his e-mails had poor spelling and grammar.  He did not answer any specific questions.  The address he sent the registered mail (the check) was a rental apartment in a shady neighbourhood near strip clubs in Hamilton. None of this added up. I have shredded the check and blocked Gary's email and phone numbers.

T2Y 2M3,"May 09, 2016",LYNX Consulting,"I BELIEVE I WAS A VICTIM OF AN ONLINE EMPLOYMENT FRAUDULENT ACT At a glance, their website was professional looking and inviting to the wonderful possibly of a great job opportunity, so I immediately responded to a guy called Ronald Lumb, IT Manager rsquo s emails and said I would be happy to accept the position of Executive Administrative Assistant to the COO. They said they were moving their company to Calgary, Alberta on June 6, 2016 and I needed to search for furniture pricing, quotes, pictures, downtown Hotels to accommodate them when they arrived. They even went as far to draw up a Job Acceptance Letter that I had to sign and send back to them, which I did. I immediately proceeded to research what they had on their list. The first call I received from a guy that called himself Michael, told me that I should receive a Company Credit Card to purchase the furniture and office supplies and equipment and the cheque made payable to me for 3 weeks of salary. Once I got off the telephone I realized something was terribly wrong and I should read their website from A-Z and see if something might be out of sync. What raised the following red flags:  bull 	They had 3 errors on the website.  bull 	The address and number was from 2 different Cities and the Company didn rsquo t exist in the City in which it states.  bull 	The Job Acceptance Letter said I would be working for the COO but there was no mention of his name. The letter stated my official start date was May 15, 2016, yet they wanted me to research pricing, etc. immediately.  bull 	I received a cheque via UPS but no Company Credit Card.  bull 	He asked me to immediately deposit the cheque in my bank account, which I did. After doing this, I decided to research the company and bank name rsquo s addresses. I contacted the company and the bank and they said they have not issued this cheque and don rsquo t have any dealings with one another.  bull 	I kept getting a telephone call from Ronald Lumb, IT Manager asking if the cheque cleared. I said no it hasn rsquo t, it takes 5 business days to clear. He said: It should only take 2 days maximum.  bull 	They called me from an unknown number, so their company name would not appear on my telephone display area.  bull 	He wouldn rsquo t answer any of my questions regarding the Company Card and how much of that money was to be disbursed to furniture, office supplies and equipment. He kept saying: I need to speak to Michael and will call you back, which he never did.  bull 	They had strong broken English and I could barely understand them. I kept asking them to repeat themselves. My concerns are: they have my signature and address in their possession and I cashed an illegal cheque. I contacted my bank to advise them of this and they said all that will happen, it will be rejected and sent back to where it came from and no money will be deposited into my account. I rsquo ve kept all of the exchanged emails and a copy of the Job Acceptance Letter  and I rsquo ve written down the information that was on the cheque for my records and the UPS envelope.

Malcolm, NE 68402. The ""owner"" of this company calls himself James Drake although he also uses the name Lee Aarons.  His modus operandi is that, after joining several author's groups via Facebook, he contacts self-publishing authors via private message requesting either samples or complete works by the targeted author.  He then signs them to an exclusive contract, with the author signing over book rights to Drake. Over the course of months, he maintains contact with ""his"" authors on a fairly regular basis, reporting various activities he claims to have completed i.e. getting the author's books into major book stores such as Barnes  amp  Noble and Indigo Bridge. He also claims that Indigo Bridge is affiliated with Indigo Chapters Canada and can get the book released throughout the U.S. and Canada. I have since learned that Indigo Bridge not only has never heard of Drake but Indigo Bridge is in no way affiliated with Indigo Chapters Canada. A few weeks ago, in a group chat where issues regarding payment and product was being discussed, he claimed that he was in way over his head and that he was returning the publishing rights to each individual author and they could hire him as a consultant. He sent payment schedules to each author, offering various forms of payment i.e. bank transfer, Paypal, Western Union, personal check, etc.  To date, the vast majority of authors have yet to receive payment.  In some cases, the personal checks have bounced. Thru various conversations between the authors, it was discovered that this is not the first time he's pulled this scam.  It seems he brings on a group of authors, sends the book to Ingram and Amazon then receives payment from Ingram and Amazon.  Instead of passing the money to the rightful owner (the author) he seems to be using the current group to pay the previous group as he most likely spent the money.  As I said, this is not the first time he's pulled this scam.  Drake has also claimed that he is no longer taking on new authors however, within days after announcing he was no longer acting as publisher, he has started actively recruiting people who he doesn't realize are aware of his scam, looking to create yet another new group so he can use their income to pay for the previous group.  Knowing there was a group of authors that have already been thru this with him, it appears that he's using the money generated by book sales from group B (the most current group) to pay group A and now is attempting to recruit group C to pay those in group B that are yelling the loudest.  I'm certain his has no intention of paying each and every author as there are authors in group A that still haven't been paid 2 years later.","{'la': 43.255043, 'lo': -79.777222, 'rlo': -1.392375191994455, 'rla': 0.754942918441725}",3000.0

I received an email from a Tony Hamilton who worked for Human Resources at Shoppers Canada stating that they had accepted my application. He asked for my mailing address so they could send me out a Cheque so I could begin my first assignment as a Secret Shopper Agent. I received the Cheque on March 15.  It was in the sum of $1864.70. I was to deposit it and then send a picture of the bank teller receipt as proof of deposit. I was instructed to email it to Canada Shoppers at info@canadashopps.com.  Then Tony Hamilton called me.

I was to go to a Shoppers Drug Mart in St Albert, Alberta. I was to be a secret customer and evaluate the performance of the teller at the post office in shoppers drug mart.

V6B 1A7,"Mar 21, 2016",Jasmine Pike/Simona,"I work in the film industry. I have recently heard multiple complaints from people looking for work as a background extra that they have been scammed by a woman who refers to herself as both Jasmine Pike and Simona. Qualified Background Agents do not charge background extras who they hire onto their roster, and receive payment via commission on any work they secure for their rostered background extras. All complainants stated that this woman was charging $200 to sign up with her, yet had received no work in exchange, sometimes up to a year later. When I called Jasmine-or-Simona at the number listed on the craigslist ad, and confronted her as to why she was charging $200 for what should be free, she nervously stated that this was a fee for taking photos  all that is required to do background work is a simple photo of your face that anyone can take of themselves on their phone or camera. I am incensed that people looking for work are being prayed upon in a manner that leaves them with even less money. I believe she only accepts cash. The phone number this woman can be reached at is 778-        , and her address is                 , Vancouver, BC.

I have included below some literature on the company along with a few items that will be helpful. Academic Tech Partners acquires the licenses to new inventions and technologies that are developed on college campuses and in government labs. As you may know, they receive about $25 billion dollars in grant money from the United States Government and are non-profit facilities. This prohibits most of the inventors from commercializing what they create. We are the 3rd party company that purchases the rights to sell these technologies to the general public. Once we acquire the license for the new products, we start the process of introducing them into the general market. Park Technologies covers production, distribution, marketing, and sales. Park Technologies has been commercializing technologies and inventions from Major Universities going on 3 years now. I would like to share some further details about the offer and our expectations: You would assist with Current and upcoming technology evaluations Multiple evaluations upon receiving our list will be asked of you. Upon agreeable technologies the company will use current staff to properly validate each technology sought after. Agreed upon Equity will be 50% of each technology you evaluate and decide on. This will be the same for each technology you and the company acquire over time. Our current lawyer will assess the royalty deal to be discussed with the particular inventor or school of each technology. Assistance with running the company formed will be expected upon the start-up phase. This takes place after Private Placement has been obtained for said technology, and we have the legal right to bring in pre-revenue. I have listed some websites I wish to share with you along with their corresponding passwords.

V3J 1T8,"Mar 11, 2016",Fascina Construction Inc.,"I met an owner of a ""construction company"" on a greyhound coming home from a vacation and in need of a job.  He took a liking to me and gave me his business card and said if I wanted a job to give him a call.  I have a diploma in land surveying, and was expecting a job more along those lines, but almost immediately he wanted to make me a partner to his company (Fascina construction Inc.).  This was odd to me, but he seemed to be very genuine and said things like ""I've always ran my business going by my gut"" and ""I see a lot of potential in you"" etc.  So I decided to give it a chance. From the get go I told him I was inexperienced (I am 22 with zero business experience) and wanted to take things slow.  He agreed, assuring me that I'd have all the time I need to adjust and get comfortable with running the business and managing staff, saying it isn't that hard and I'd pick it up in no time.  I started off at $25 per hour and would be put on salary if I signed the partnership agreement.  So I started working for him, shadowing him and helping him set up the ""BC division"" of the company. It didn't take long at all for him to start hitting me with high pressure sales tactics to get me to invest in the company and sign the partnership agreement.  He would say things like ""this is your company too"" to get me to sign for things and pay for expenses, promising I'd be reimbursed for it at months eds or something like that... He was taking me to dealerships and picked out two brand new premium trucks for us and had the sales people do a week's worth of work, pricing out a huge list of customizations (He never ended up getting those trucks).  We were meeting with realtor's, looking for a warehouse and office space to set up in.  There were multiple local businesses we were dealing with to get decals, equipment, furniture etc. and it all seemed above board.  he had shown me the certificate of incorporation, GST number, last year's books and a host of other things trying to get me to sign.  He was over affectionate (not in a sexual way) and started saying things like ""you're family"" and ""I'd do anything for you"" in order to build trust I assume. Around the 2 week mark is when I was expecting my first paycheck, but beanstream supposedly messed up their direct deposit and they needed to ""restructure their payroll"".  He started paying me out of his pocket in small increments of $200-$400.  This shaddy payment style went on for about a month.  In that time I had agreed to sign the partnership agreement (he is very persuasive).  My investment would be $2000 and a company vehicle, which we got from the same dealship working on the trucks. The car is a 2012 Accra approx $30,000 with taxes, warranty, and everything else added on.  The company would lease it from me making that portion of my investment being my name and credit on the car. I started having doubts about the legitimacy of the business because we never seemed to do any real work, I still hadn't seen a jobsite, any other employees, equipment, or clients.  He hooked me with delusions of granduer...  I did some snooping around some files in the office and I found a mortgage for his residence with a different first name on it.  A quick google search brought me to a newspaper article from Terrace BC about a man with the same name as the mortgage papers and age of my ""partner"" involved with multiple counts of fraud with the local businesses.  I was shocked and went to the RCMP to try and find out what to do.  They weren't allowed to give me any details on him, but one sergeant told me off the record that they new him and told me to get out of the situation... I eventually confronted him and ended the business relationship and am currently trying to get back what is owed to me.  I have recieved my pay surprisingly enough, but the $2000 investment, credit card expenses and loan payments for the car are all being held back.  He has supposedly sent the reimbursement for the credit card expenses twice via Canada post and purolator, but I haven't recieved them.  He was making the loan and insurance payments on the car (he signed a lease agreement with me) but this month he has been extremely difficult to deal with and still hasn't paid and it doesn't seem like he's going to. I am at a loss and don't know what to do, I cannot afford a lawyer and the cops were entirely useless beyond telling me they knew who he was.

T5W 1C6,"Feb 06, 2016",,"Scammers are now using job sites like Upwork to convince people they are hired and they advance money to them for 'working materials' in the form of a cheque.  They insist you deposit the cheque in an ATM (not through a teller), withdraw the money to be forwarded onward to someone else. The cheques they send are fake and PLEASE DO NOT CASH them!!!  You will be liable to the bank to pay the bank back, and in the worst case, most likely have your accounts closed and unable to open new accounts anywhere else, and possibly be charged or investigated for money laundering. Some tips when job hunting online: 1) ask for confirmation of whom you are talking to - ask at the very least for a employee ID card from the interviewer 2) get their location and verify it. 3) ensure they are communicating from their corporate email address.  Using a free service like Yahoo, or GMail is a good tell tale sign they are fake, and/or if they use free chat apps like Hangout to 'interview you'. 4) never advance money to an potential employer.  If they don't provide what you need to do your job, they probably are not legitimate 5) watch especially for 'work at home' opportunities.  These are easy targets to hide suspicious trends in their scam 6) especially watch since the job market is not the most favorable in areas with job losses  these scammers prey on those in dire times.

After a few weeks of texting back and forth, he sent me a list of items to buy and a cheque for $1,940 to cover the cost.  Since I was not comfortable in buying merchandise for someone else I told him to buy his own when they arrive.  In the meantime, I deposited his cheque into my bank account.

K2J 4R7,"Nov 10, 2015",Shopper's Voice Canada," 1. Applied to an advertisement in the paper for a Mystery Shopper.    2. Received phone call from Scott Madison of Shoppers Voice Canada, who gave me a phone interview on Monday, July 27. The pay would be $100 per  ldquo visit rdquo .    3. Scott called back on Tuesday, July 27th saying that he would like to offer me the job but I would have to be trained first. He said that a package would be arriving the following morning. Since I had a previously scheduled meeting at 2:00 PM, we agreed to call at 3:00.    4. The package arrived before I left for my meeting. It included a cover letter and a bank draft from  ldquo Tangerine Bank rdquo . The draft was for the amount of $2,256.00. At 3:00, on July 29th, I called Scott and he told me to proceed to my bank with the cheque and deposit it and withdraw $1,100. He said we would need that amount for the first portion of the  ldquo mystery shopping training. rdquo     5. I was then told to proceed to the WalMart in Barrhaven and, in particular, the Technical Department. Scott said to ask to speak to an employee and ask for something that I wasn rsquo t necessarily familiar with (but that I was familiar with). Then I was told to purchase something worth between $20 and $30 from the $1,100. When I was talking to the employee about one of the cables, he made a mistake on the price, so, I jumped at purchasing that cable, even though it was over the $30 because it was a great deal. So, my first purchase was for $39.99 plus tax.    6. I was then told to go to the McDonalds inside WalMart and describe what happened. Then I was told to go to Western Union that was within WalMart. I was to go get a  ldquo green form rdquo  and go back to McDonalds to fill it out  ndash  with his direction. He had the wire going to Fitz Chalifour  ndash  he said it was a generic name that he was getting off of a list. He said to put that he lived in Ajax, ON. And, we were going to send him $940.00 cash. I went over to the Western Union desk and the money was sent. Once that was done, I was asked for the number on the receipt  ndash  along with other information about the transaction.    7. After that, I was asked to go to Metro in Barrhaven and buy $20 to $30 in groceries and pay particular attention to the bakery department because they had complaints about bread being stale. So, I bought a few things and spent $35. Then when I was leaving the store, he called me to see how things were. He asked a few things about the outside of the store. Then he asked me to do another Western Union transfer. He gave me some information  ndash  again going to the fictitious Fitz Chalifour but this time he lived in Toronto, Ontario and the phone number I was given was 613-769-1966. This time, the $940.00 came out of my bank account from the remainder of the Bank Draft noted above.    8. Once that transaction was completed, then I was asked to head over to Shopper rsquo s Drug Mart and purchase a Vanilla Visa Card in the amount of $150. He then asked me for the number on the back of the card so that they could use the Visa Card.    9. I was asked to put the receipts from Western Union and the Visa into an envelope and send it to Kevin Washington at 20 Blue Jays Way, Toronto, ON, M5V 3W7.    10. They had made a mistake by not sending me another cheque the following day as it is their preference that the training is held on three consecutive days. When that opportunity was missed, the long weekend was upon us so, they had to wait until Tuesday, August 4th. That is when two more cheques arrived. One in the amount of $2,256 and one for $2,356. That is when we realized that the first cheque had bounced, which meant that I was out $2,256.00. If I had done this for three consecutive days, I would have been scammed out of $6,868!!    11. This fraudulent activity has been reported to the police and the report number is 15-196135. Since then, the receipts that were sent to ""Blue Jays Way"" were returned. Today, I received a text from MFX INVESTMENTS - phone number - 613-793-5538. It read as follows: ""MFX INVESTMENTS are currently hiring Shoppers in Canada. Earn $300 per evaluation.

I Had then received a phone call ""interview"" with a woman who sounded very professional, educated and asked usual job interview questions, they said they are a strictly Canadian company, and highly rated.  I had then received a letter in the mail with a cheque enclosed, saying I had been approved to be a mystery shopper.  I searched they company online and found nothing about a scam and when I searched the address it showed me there company name and everything I could find made it seem legitimate to me.  The letter had 2 assignments that needed to be done after which I needed to fax the attached service evaluation forms and all receipts of purchases to them and when completed to phone your ""assignment coordinator"" to verify completion.  Assignment 1 was to go to one of the following retailers: Walmart, Costco, HomeDepot, Sears or Best buy, and spend $100 on a product of my choice.  There were detailed instructions about what I should be checking for (i.e. service, cleanliness, products) as well as ""Customer Service Evaluation Sheets"" that had to be filled out. Assignment 2 was to Send $1865.00 through Western Union. They wrote that the reason the amount is so high is because they have been receiving complaints of people being interrogated by employees when trying to send more than $1000, and being treated unprofessionally especially to people wanting to send money to other contries. They also wanted to know if they were asking for proper ID and following all protocol, they wanted me to write down what kind of ID they asked for, if they took photocopies, as well as my service.  I also had a form for that assignment that needed to be faxed back.  The cheque sent in the mail was for $2396.23, It said that $400 of the cheque is my service fee, $100 of it was to buy the products for assignment 1, $1865 plus $31.23 service charge was for the western union assignment. They said in the letter that I needed to deposit the cheque in my own account to verify that it is me.  The letter had a Rep ID# that it said I would be using on all assignments and that if I had any questions to call the provided number.  It turns out it was all a scam and the cheque never cleared, luckily I only spend the $100 on the product assignment but I got stuck with the $48 NFS fee.  I was waiting for the cheque to clear completely before doing the Western Union transfer, but I found out that what they wanted was for me to send the money before the cheque bounced.
