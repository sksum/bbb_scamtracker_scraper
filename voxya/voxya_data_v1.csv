Hi Gaurav, 

Thanks for all your information.

There is a mismatch on calculation , I informed earlier **nd Oct I have sent  my resignation and my LWD **th Nov and you may calculate the number of days where you have mentioned the ** Days notice i have served.
Organization prospective I don't want to hamper any work and decided on my own because there is no information I got from the date of  joining  which i supposed to receive after joining but it was not done by Talentpro.
Do you have any signed documentation where I have to submit ** days of notice period than why there is deduction related to notice period.

LWD **th Nov and you are asking to accept your organization policy on ** Dec which is not atoll acceptable.
Instead of admitting your mistake you are forcing me  to accept an agreement after ** days of my LWD.

Giving * more days to fix this settlement without any deductions else I will send legal notice where all indicated organisation mistake but forcefully you people asking to do adjustment with settlement.

Note: Next upcoming document you will receive from court if there is no action from your end and addition cost related to advocate charges and harassment will be liable to (Flipkar/Telentpro)

Hi Gaurav, 

I don't have any access left to see and to accept your terms and conditions because it is too late.
If required to serve a one month notice period why was it not documented earlier when I joined?
As per offered latter it should be duly signed by an employee after getting from HR but it was not taken care by Telent Pro.
Took Feedback from other colleague about appointment letter but still it is pending, I don't want to go inside to give more comment on this
Full and Final settlement number of days also there is no information by HR and no signed copy done by me but still it is pending since **th Nov ****.

** Days Payout + Balance Leave Adjustment to be calculated as F&F

Hope you understand, Please let me know if i am wrong but if I found any deduction due to your obligation where i have not signed by me then i will  push this as legally to recover.
And this is the final call from my end and I will be not responsible for any cause for damage to your business.

Addressing Gurgaon District Court Advocate: Sanjeev to understand my Concern and accordingly i will share my information related activity done

Looking for your support to close this without further discussion.

Regards
Vijay Kumar

There are couple of points which I could have written in a sensible and a professional manner but I don’t think that this organisation deserves that, so I am intentionally writing bare facts with details:
The most important thing is cheating, they cheated me and I think others as well. By committing yearly **% deduction due to corona, they deducted **% in Q* (April-June) and ** % in Q* (July - September) due to cash flow issues but they laid off me and may be other employees before normal cycle starts i.e. October. So I worked for them in **% salary that too overseas deployment. Although I will take legal action against the organisation citing cheating, non-compliance of the offer letter etc. will see what happens. I hope I will get the justice. 
Following further:
HR Policy: 
*.	My official joining date was *st Feb **** i.e. Saturday, I was about to join on the same day but one day prior I got a call from HR that on *st Feb budget will be announced and everyone will be busy there, so you can join by *rd Feb. I never saw this type of mind-set just to save the salary of two days, I don’t see any other logic to postpone the joining date.

*.	On the joining, HR asked me to submit an original document like mark sheet, birth certificate etc. Don’t know the logic behind that but I guess they know that they will going to humiliate/harass the employees that can be one of the reason. Even I heard that they ask for bond, not to me, in this era so you can understand the level of insecurity.

Further, HR informed me that salary for the first * months will be given by **th of the following month rather than *th, , no logic behind that too, like we gonna run away by taking their salaries after *th.
Salary, Allowances, and other Perks: 
*.	At the time of the interview, Partner told me that we usually pay ** AED per day as an allowance and stay will be arranged by them. 
I was about to leave by *th of Feb and till *th of Feb no one informed me the exact allowance policy, in the evening I got to know that total allowance will be AED **** including stay and in UAE average bachelor stay costs around **** – **** AED that too sharing.  Being at a manager position I was expecting a separate room (costs around ****-**** AED). I have to manage that also.
*.	Every month I used to get the allowance from the UAE deployed personal but that too I have to ask at least *-* times and usually got somewhere around **th of the month. You can imagine how one can survive a half a month in a city like UAE, thanks to my cousin, he used to help me for a short time.

*.	At the time of fixing the allowance for UAE, it was informed to me that taxi fare will be reimbursed on an actual basis (that’s a different story that a Manager level employee has to take approval for a taxi even) and it was somewhere around *** AED from February till June which I got somewhere in August that too after more than ** follow-ups. 

*.	Now the story of Corona-virus begins, March ** or **, the lockdown was announced in India and I was in UAE only and this time we got only **% of the salary due to corona, you can imagine the financial position of the organization since lockdown was announced only in the last week of the month. This doesn’t stop here, we got **% of the March’s pending salary in June end and the remaining **% in July.

*.	Now let's talk Insurance, the company doesn’t have taken Insurance of mine, you can imagine I have been in Dubai for almost * months without Insurance that too in Corona Pandemic  When I enquired about it I got to know that they forgot due to some internal misunderstanding and now Insurance could not be taken since Indian Companies Insurance is not valid after immigration and UAE insurance is not for Visit Visa holders. I was Shocked!
*.	Now let’s talk about salary deduction, we got only **%  for April and May month and we have been informed that this was not a deduction just a deferment, same is mentioned in salary slip, so we were fine with that assuming that we will get it later. 

Now the day comes **th June ****, we got an email from HR that salary deduction is ** % from April to June month and ** % for July to September, emphasizing **% deduction on CTC. I was shocked again! I was in Dubai, I can’t even manage my EMI’s (My Bank didn’t accept moratorium for June-August period) in that, I requested them a couple of times that apportion the difference consistently over the year so that we can manage our expenditure but no one listened to me. I even told them how you can apply the same level of policy to employees based out of India and UAE since you are benefitting more from UAE clients but no one listened to me.

I even spoke with the partner and he told me that due to cash flow issues we have decided to deduct **% and **% but yearly its **% only so at the time of Full & Final Payment I asked them to pay the differential salary but they didn’t. They actually cheated me.
Work Culture:
*.	Now let’s talk about work culture, I have experience of handling Internal Audits, due diligence, IFC etc. but they gave me the first assignment that too was SOP, the other two were Division of Books Accounts and ESR. I was happy that I got an opportunity to work for different types of assignments I had given my best efforts and delivered quality output and the client was very happy with that. Thereafter they gave me ESR (Economic Substance Regulation, newly introduced in UAE), so you can imagine where IA and ESR.

**.	Initially when we had a conference call pertains to ESR where couple of junior colleagues were also available, on one particular topic my partner said “Tu jis school me padta he na uska Princpal hu me” and I was thinking like because of me and my friends Vice-Principal took a leave of around * months, one can validate the facts from my school. Further you can imagine the maturity level if a partner is using these types of phrases.

As per him I don’t know anything and even told me what Big-* guys do, he is a Chartered of **** and I even worked for the Chartereds of **** to **** and got positive feedback from them also (check my LinkedIn).  

**.	Resignation: Because of all this mess I finally resigned on **rd June **** (last date of ESR filling in UAE was **th June). Next day early morning I got a call from Partner and he asked me the reason of putting papers I explained him and he agreed that there were some issues from their side and asked me to think about my resignation, I didn’t express him clearly my willingness to continue but the was the discussion was done I was an impression that things are sorted and there is no need to send a formal resignation withdrawal mail. 

**.	I was in an impression that my job is safe but in mid of July, I enquired with the HR about balance March month’s salary so she told me that it was held due to resignation and I was shocked, I got my June month’s salary on due date so thought my resignation withdrawal was accepted. So I explained HR that I already had a discussion with (KB) and she told me to drop a formal resignation withdrawal email, I did that too on same day but after few days I got an email that my resignation is accepted and will let you know the last working day, shocked again!

They used me till the time their assignment was going on in UAE after that tata-bye bye.

Have you ever seen the policy where firm is withholding yr previous month’s salary because of resignation. Withholding of prospective month’s salary is the industry practice but previous months, I don’t know which dictionary they refer.

**.	I forgot to write one more thing, they do tell their employees to write positive reviews about the organization on public domain and do the rigorous follow up for the same if you will not do, they will take strict action. So the positive reviews written here might be…..you got it I think. 

They will do the marketing to that extent like attractive web pages, LinkedIn, client testimonial videos etc. and like others I also trapped in the same. No doubt like all consulting firm this organisation is also very professional in delivering quality stuff to the client but from job perspective it’s a waste.

**.	From data security perspective also this organisation is not good. Believe me they are using pirated Windows, Microsoft office, Antivirus etc and simultaneously marketing ITGC audit, you can imagine.

**.	I served * yrs in one of Big-* and *.* yrs (one of the renowned consulting firm), so I don’t think that my expectation was out of the Universe. 
One point I wanted to conclude is that this firm is not for those who have previously worked in very organized or systematic companies rather this organization fits for fresher or passive nature person with no expectation because this a hard-core desi firm. Even with one of the new joinee (junior of mine) they have reduced the salary by giving excuse of work quality like which professional organisation does that, only desi firm do.
After seeing this post HR may give justification or will say that all are false allegations but believe me I am not that much creative to visualize vague points to this extent. 
It is the first time I am writing a review over my +* yrs career because I never felt that but this time I just want that people should think twice/thrice before joining.

Even they threatened me via police, sent me notice of ** lac just to harass me..even now my partial salary from March to July is due and which is amounting to Rs. *.** lac including my Fix Bonus...I spent around Rs. ** k as well on legal fees ",OPEN

This is with regarding Job cheating and mental harassment in pregnant time from the company called ADI Software Systems owner name Aditya Abhinath Desai Ph No ********** email ID hr@adisoftwaresystems.com collecting money from people in the name of training and job placement and issue fake offer letter and cheating people.
I was searching for job and my profile shared with company called ADI Software Systems #***/* Poornima Plaza Doddathoguru Main Road, Konappana Agrahara Electronic City, Bengaluru, ******. Email ID hr@adisoftwaresystems.com website www.adisoftwaresystems.com 
 I received call from HR Purushotham Kumar G Ph No ********** employee ID SW*** residing address #*-*-**, vidyanagar colony, Tirupathi – ****** from ADI Software on April *th for the position SAP Consultant.

After completion of training, they assured that they will deploy with client and they will pay Rs.*.* lakhs p.a. 
Therefore, they said to accept this offer I should pay Rs.*, **,***.** for SAP training and placement to ADI Software. I paid Rs. *, **,***.** to the person called Pranav Kumar Reddy who is relative of mine resident of house # **-*** nehru bajar, Chitoor, Andra Pradesh – ****** Ph No ********** on **/**/**** NEFT reference # ************ / ************. 
I received an offer letter Ref.No. ADS-BNG-SW***-** issue date **/**/**** from ADI Software  Systems. Joining dated **th April **** as SAP Consultant and salary offered Rs.*.* Lakh p.a. I submitted all my education and experience documents for background verification.
The online training started on April **th **** from the trainer Nemith Ph No **********. The training continued for only * weeks daily * hour online training and stopped. I visited to office in May *nd week to discuss with Aditya. Due to corona lock down I was not able to visit office and meet Aditya or any one in office. When I went to office, I was carrying at that time *tht month pregnant still I went all the way to meet Aditya regarding training salary and future career aspects. Aditya promised and convinced me for bright future with company. 
In June **** it was already *rd month with company and did not received any salary when I call HR Purushotham he said I will get * months salary together. I was continuously follow up by phone and daily visiting office being pregnant in covid time travelling daily ** kms up and down to meet HR Purushotham and Aditya Desai for salary but everytime Aditya just giving false commitment and every time it’s failed. 
Even though I am Pregnant in covid time I use to travel in Bus daily incurring Rs.*** bus fare to meet Aditya and I use to explain him my situation that I am in need of job how important this job in such condition but Aditya and Purushotham just giving false commitment and convincing and I followed up continuously up to * months pregnant still they did not paid any salary or no job.
Finally I requested to refund my money back of Rs. *,**,***.** with Aditya but again he just giving false date fake promises with no intention to refund. 
Now my delivery has happened and I have lot of expenses towards my baby my maternity and I got cheated from this company. Depending on this company wasted, my * months with no salary not tried job anywhere and its affected my career life and personal life both. 
ADI Software is just fake company they just issuing fake offer letters to people and cheating people by collecting the money in the name of job.

I have to file a complainst against my previous employer Milkway Services. They are not paying my long dues pending from last six months. They relieved me from the services instantly without giving any prior notifications in the month of May, **** by sending a formal mail from the official mail id. In the mail they mentioned about the restructure of their business model as it was affected due to COVID-**. They ensured me to clear all my dues (salary and other deductions) soon after the office reopens. In the mail, they have clearly mentioned the Pandemic reason behind releasing me from services with a suggestion to search for new job, great appreciation of my work and best of luck for my future.

Now, it has been more than two months, office is reopen, and they are not paying my dues. They sent me a new mail with denying the payment of dues with allegations that i violated the company policy thats why company is not paying me the dues.

It has been waiting for my dues from last six months, for company everything was ok with my while releaving me from the services, but now after this much time they are denying payment by imposing false allegations on me. If there would have been such issue from my end, then why didn't company inform at the time of my relieving ( May ****). 

My request for you (VOXYA ) is to go through the matter, contact the company and ask them to clear my all dues. 

Also, suggest me what action should I take if company denies to pay my dues.

This is Richard Horo, I would like to inform you that I am being cheated by Ms. Kajol bharti from B-*. ***, yogi hills, Silvasa, Dadar Nagar haweli Email id - kajol.bharti.**@gmail.com, mobile number - **********, ********** & Mr. Kalyan from Noida, UP mobile number **********. I have attached their contact details below. Kajol is my immediate junior in Banaras Hindu University in ****. We were not in touch after ****. But she contacted me in june **** and offered me a business opportunity which she was doing for the last * months but she did not reveal anything about the company or business. She only told me that we have some SOP Slandered procedures so we can not tell you anything about the business until you join this business. I asked several times about the company or business but she never told me anything except the business is a project basis and we get paid after completing the project. She also said that we do cost optimization and search engine optimization for ** lineup industries that's it. She also told me that now this business is going to expand pan India basis and there are only * seats across pan India. She said, you need to face a few interviews and on the basis of your interview you would be selected or rejected. My first interview was taken by Ms Shivangi Rai, from Allahabad, Mobile number - ********** then immediately Ms Shivangi Shukla, Paris, France, Europe mobile number - ********** took my interview and they all made me emotional fool by saying their so called emotional stories that how they suffered due to lack of money in their childhood and now they are making crore rupees, they have expensive cars, watches, luxury items and elite lifestyle all because of this business. She also told me that I have to pay * lakhs seventy thousands ""*.** lakhs"",  because no business starts without capital. Shivangi told me that I will be informed by Kajol whether I am selected or rejected. After the meeting, Kajol called me in the evening and told me that you are selected but you need to pay a token amount of **** seven thousands rupees initially to book your seat first because there are * people selected for * seat. So whoever is paid first, he or she will be given preference. So I paid **** token money on ** july **** through upi. Then kajol told me that I have to pay the rest of the amount in * days. But when I was unable to arrange the whole amount within the given time period, she asked me to send whatever amount I have so that they come to know that I am trying to arrange money. So anyhow I arranged ""*****"" seventy three thousands and transferred to her PNB saving account number - ****************, ifsc - PUNB******* on ** july **** by upi. Then on the next day ** july I transferred ""*****"" twenty five thousands through upi and ""*****"" twenty five thousands through my sbi internet banking and the same day I asked my friend Saurav Bhattacharya to transfer ***** forty thousands rupees to kajol's account. Because I was unable to transfer more money to Kajol on the same day. After transferring the whole money *.* lacks, my online training started with few more people with kalyan on zoom.

                                                                           I asked several times on a regular basis if it is network marketing or Direct selling and is it Q.net but Kajol bharti and Kalyan always said ""NO"" this is not network marketing, this is not direct selling and this is not Q.net. I clearly told them if it is network marketing then I am not gonna do this business.

But after transfer ""*.** Lacks"" One lacks seventy thousands to Kajol Bharti PNB saving account and after * meetings on zoom with Kalyan, on *rd meeting he said that it is network marketing & direct selling. Then just after the meeting I told Kajol that you told me a lie and you cheated on me, but she refused that she did not know that it is a direct selling or network marketing and anyhow she managed me to talk to kalyan once again so that he will clear all your doubts and answer all your question. In that meeting I again asked the same * question  is it network marketing or Direct selling and is it Q.net but he refused and said ""No"" this is not network marketing or direct selling nor Q.net and on the top of that  he asked me that what is Q.net and what does it do ! Anyhow he again managed to manipulate me by saying that you will answer all your questions later. 

                             But I felt being cheated again at *th meeting on zoom by Kalya where he said that it is Q.net itself. I asked Kalyan that i have some questions but he refused to answer that time by saying that write down your question we will discuss at the next meeting. Because there were some more participants as well. Then I called Kajol but she did not receive them after I messaged her on whatsapp that I don't want to do this business anymore because you people cheated on me. You guys are fraud. Then she again tried to manipulate me to please do not panic and have a word with Kalyan sir but I said that I want my money back that's it. Then she started ignoring my calls and messages. Then I tried to contact Mr. Manish from Allahabad, Contact number is ********** one of the team leaders. I talked to him and explained everything then he assured me that you will get your money in your account by this monday ** August **** but I did not receive my money. 

                           So I would request the Q.net global support team please look into this matter and please take legal action against these frauds and please make sure that I get my money as soon as possible.

We were not in touch with each other for many years as we did not had each other's contact number. But as we were Facebook friends one day suddenly he started chatting with me on a facebook messanger. We shared each other numbers on messanger. After some days he called me up and asked me about my job,company,work culture.When I asked him,  he said that his life is awsome as he is into some kind of business. That day he didn't discussed anything about his work other than that. Even I didn't bothered much. But after some days he called me and asked weather I was serious in my life and weather I want to achieve  my dreams. I repliefd yes definately, who does not wants to acchive their dreams  Then he reminded of a discussion that happened some days back. He asked me weather I was looking for the same thing that he was doing. If yes then he will try to arrange my meeting with his senior partner. I tried to ignore him as I was satisfied with my job and I usually don't trust such type of businesses. He kept on calling and following up with me for the continuos  *-* months. On *st July **** I was asked to resign from my service I got tensed as it was a time of lockdown and I won't get any job in this time. Then i remembered of my colleague. Then I called him and asked about his business.But he was not ready to disclose the the whole thing about his company. He said that I will arrange a meeting with my senior partner and there you will get to know the whole thing. Then my meeting was arranged with his senior partner on zoom. In the meeting also I was not told properly about a business. I was just shown a big dreams. I was asked to arrange a funds of Rs. ******. Once a funds will be arranged then the second meeting would be conducted and there all about the business would be discussed. It was not possible to arrange such a big amount.So I accordingly informed my colleague.He said that he will talk to his senior partner and let me know what can be done. After some time he called me and told me that there is an offer right now where you can start a business with lesser amount of Rs,******. Still that amount was to much for me. My freind gave me a option to use credit card and break an Recurring deposit and transfer the amount to his account. But before giving him a credit card details I asked him about a company s name. Then he lied me that his company s name is conglomrri group of companies. Then on the basis of trust I sent him a credit card picture on whatsapp on **.**.**** and on the same day amount of rs. ***** was spent on my credit card. I got transaction message and also a snap of credit card which I sent him on a whatsapp. On the same day I broke a recurring deposit of Rs. ***** and transferred an amount of Rs.***** to his account.i got the snap of this transactions as well for a evidence.The he asked me to arrange more funds by asking my friends and advised me to take money from my friends by asking for a personal use and not for a business purpose. But as some of my friends were close I said them that I need it for business purpose. There they advised me to not get into any type of such business where the things are not clear. Then it created a doubt in my mind and stopped arranging further funds I accordingly informed my colleague and told him that it's not possible to arrange more funds. Then he told me that he himself will put the remaining funds and arrange a second round of meeting. When meeting was arranged on zoom it made me clear that this is a network marketing and I realised that this is not my cup of tea. Also the company s name was disclosed which is Qnet. Then it came to my mind that the company name which my colleague told to me was wrong. He told it to me purposely just to misguide me. I was made to sign a contract forcefully on July **.**.****. There they mentioned that I had purchased and received a product which costed around Rs. ******. They purchased it without my knowledge and neither I received that product. Then I searched on the site for the process of refund. There they mentioned that refund is possible within ** days but for that I will need a IR I'd which was not given to me purposely as per my knowledge. When I enquired him regarding the same he said me that it takes time to get generated. But when I contacted in a customer care they said me that it gets generated as soon as you get registered. They asked me to send a mail from registered email id which I had given. But when I sent a mail I got a reply that your email id is not registered which means my colleague had purposely given a wrong email id.

She said it's completely genuine , no need to worry , you just do your work and all that bullshit. I trusted her initially but then I started doubting on her and the company. So I did a a little bit of research on the internet. There were lot of complaints against Digitech company in Quora.com and other complaints registering sites.

After searching for Immigration Visa consultants in India on internet and leaving my contact details on the website of some Visa immigration consultants, I received calls from an employee of Prominent Overseas Careers in its Hyderabad branch and my discussions started over phone calls with this employee of Prominent Overseas for PR Visa consultancy to New Zealand, for me. As this employee and another employee of prominent Overseas started following up with me rigorously over calls and whatsapp messages, asking me to deposit some amount with them to start my new Zealand immigration process , I deposited an amount of Rs.***** (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) on **nd february,**** ,through the online payment link provided by this employee of Prominent Overseas as a token amount, against the total consultancy fee amount of Rs.****** ,as communicated by this employee . However I asked for the copy of draft agreement from this employee on my email (which they execute with their clients before starting consultancy services and taking full payment from their client but made exception of full payment in my case as per this employee) to study their terms and conditions and also the services they will provide me under New Zealand Visa consultancy. After going through this agreement draft, I found many discrepancies in the clauses of this agreement draft to my disadvantage, so i wrote back to Prominent Overseas Employee to provide me clarification on my queries before I make the balance payment of their consultancy fees and sign this agreement for execution. The employee reverted back to some of my queries but I found many of my queries unanswered to my satisfaction. Meanwhile I also discovered while doing some fact finding on New Zealand Immigration Authority website that Prominent Overseas is not Registered with new Zealand Immigartion Authority to extend any consultancy services to its clients for New Zealand Visa. This made me suspicious of the credentials of Prominent Overseas as the correct immigration Visa consultant for my New Zealand Visa application. So I demanded immediate refund of the amount of Rs.***** deposited by me earlier on **nd February,****,on the online payment gateway link provided by Prominent employee , through phone calls to this employee and also email to this employee and another mail id of Prominent. However Prominent employee kept trying to convince me that there was no problem with their having no Registration with New Zealand immigration authority as none of the consultants in India is registered with New Zealand Immigration authority for providing Visa Consultancy to its clients. I found this claim of Prominent to be false and also shared with them the screenshot of New Zealand Immigration Authority website which states otherwise.
I have been ever since writing mails to Prominent Overseas to refund the amount of Rs.***** back to me as I am no longer interested in taking their services and they should also refund this amount to me as they have not provided any services to me so far. But they are not replying to my emails, instead Prominent employee called me and asked me if i had any doubts to which I again told them the same thing that I do not find Prominent Overseas Careers to be trustworthy to provide me Visa consultancy and they should refund the amount to me for the reason that I am no more interested in taking their services.
But they have still not refunded the amount back to me.

UAN : ************
On **.**.**** a request for EPF transfer was made from EPF A/C number GNGGN***************** to EPF A/C number MHBAN***************** an amount of Rs.*,**,*** through NEFT on **.**.**** from organization HCL Technologies Ltd to Accenture Solution Pvt Ltd.
On **.**.****  it was informed by Gurgaon EPF Office that transfer process was complete (Transfer out) against claim id - GNGGN************. At the same time Bandra EPF office reported that EPF transfer in was completed against claim id- MHBAN************, **.**.**** (All those communication was made through EPF site)
How can it be possible??? 
Moreover the transfer amount has not reflected in EPF passbook. Finally Annexure K was collected from  previous organization  HCL Technologies Ltd. After that  several grievances were registered in EPF portal (Grievance No. - BANIV/E/****/*****, BANIV/E/****/*****)  requesting to resolve the matter along with  Annexure K, but every time  Bandra EPFO is showing their negligence and closing the matter by refereeing the case to Delhi Head Office. Statement of Bandra EPFO is - “inform you that the amount as per Annexure K is not reflected in this office record. Hence Annexure K towards transfer of fund forwarded to Head Office, New Delhi for verification, confirmation and reconciliation of transferred amount and other details.”
This type of harassment is going on for last * and half year. Suddenly on **th June, **** (????) (Grievance Reg. No. BANIV/E/****/*****) EPF department informed that – “PF transferred amount is Rs.*,**,*** received by the office and same will be credited and reflected on beneficiary’s current PF account shortly”.
Now, the question is “shortly” means how many days?
Again, on **.**.**** another grievance was registered against non-payment by the PF department. On same day **.**.**** PF department responded (Reg. No. BANIV/E/****/*****) that “ the transferred amount of PF is not reflected in their office record and Annexture K is forwarded to Head Office, New Delhi. 
Then what is the relevance of the previous mail. How long I have to wait and watch such comedy show. No body is looking into the matter and showing any kind of responsibility. EPFO is not working at all and simply passing the matter from one department to other giving excuse of the present pandemic situation. Such type of activity clearly proves incompetence and worthlessness of EPF department.  I am afraid of losing interest on the transferred amount due to callousness of our esteemed EPFO.

Unlike the other scam ones, this one looked authentic as they have a proper customer work platform and a contact number and a professional email ID. On registering, a representative messaged me on WhatsApp regarding the security deposit needed and when I started doubting their scheme, the representative started sending me some screenshots of payments made to customers who had registered for the data entry and had given the deposit and completed the job. The screenshots looked fake when I started comparing them to my own Paytm payments page, but then I decided to pay the deposit of **** INR for novel writing and do the job. As mentioned by Foretell Realty, there are two kinds of deposits, **** INR for novel writing and **** INR for excel data. The company asks for the deposit for data security, as the data which they give the customer to enter is important, and the company would go in loss and have data security breach if the customer decided to not submit the work. On a presentation file, the representative sent me, it was mentioned that if there are any mistakes, they will give it back to the customer to rechecking and resubmission and that whether the work submitted is approved or rejected will be posted on the company work forum in * days. I submitted my work on the *th of May, **** and today is the **th of May, ****, which makes it * days today and yet the company has not changed the status of my work. On the *th of May, the representative messaged me on WhatsApp that my work is rejected and money won’t be refunded but it is still showing ‘Pending for Approval’ on the site. When I asked about the rechecking mentioned in the ppt, the representative messaged that it is not possible, that they don’t provide the rechecking window, it is just mentioned in the ppt. And regarding them taking the deposit for data security, the data they provide the consumer for the job are random extracts from different non-fiction and fiction articles and stories all around the world. If one would type a phrase from each page they provide, they would find that those are lines from different reports and stories available on the internet. So them telling you the deposit is for data security is bullshit. In the end, when I decided to call the number provided on the site of Foretell Realty, nobody receives the call. I called that number a dozen times, messages multiple times but no answer. On emailing them on their professional email provided, I get the notification that I can’t email anything to that email address. All I could depend on was the 'representative' who was messaging me via an unknown number, without any official tag.",OPEN

He called me that there is a business opportunity. He introduced me to Shalu Soni, Amit Pagar, and Amolika Jaiswal as his business partner.

NITIN PATANKAR said it an E-commerce business and we have to work on a Microsoft Portal Site. I asked to share the link to the ""Microsoft Portal Site"", after that I will tell my opinion. ON that he said TRUST me its a good opportunity, we will tell you everything once you join the Business.

I clearly asked QNet IRs [Nitin Patankar, Shalu Soni, Amit Pagar, Amolika Jaiswal], Hope I don't have to ADD more people once I join. On that, They said nothing like that!

I clearly asked QNet IRs [Nitin Patankar, Shalu Soni, Amit Pagar, Amolika Jaiswal], At the time of making DEMAND DRAFT, I can trust you, Hope I don't have to ADD People. On that, They said nothing like that!

I clearly asked QNet IRs [Nitin Patankar, Shalu Soni, Amit Pagar, Amolika Jaiswal], I am the only SOLO person earning in the family, many responsibilities I have, Hope I don't have to ADD People. On that, They said nothing like that!

ON their [Nitin Patankar, Shalu Soni, Amit Pagar, Amolika Jaiswal] TRUST, I took * lacs loan from HDFC Bank. Note: Even if you take any CREDIT CARD also, you TRUST that guy and don't read **-page credit card documents, because of TRUST, Right? We don't have time in a busy life, we sign on TRUST.

Also, I was told by QNET IR Amolika Jaiswal that you will get a VERIFICATION CALL from QNET that you understand all policies, that is just for formality sake, Just say YES YES to that! The call is just for internal formality.

Post, I joined QNET [On the First week], I was given * books to read and few VIDEOS to watch by QNET IR ""Amit Pagar"", that took me more than ** days to complete. That was the TRAP/CATCH. Books and Videos are TRAP to keep you busy for ** days, by that time your REFUND time gets over. As Per QNet Money REFUND period is * Days.

Voxya Team, I would be very grateful to you if you could do the needful and get my money REFUNDED as soon as possible as it is more than *+ years paying BANK EMIs for * LACS (Still Paying), you can understand my situation, the kind of MENTAL and FINANCIAL loss I have been carrying out since last * years. I have sent multiple emails to QNET support them but they are safeguarding their people and not taking any action. After running behind QNET IRs for *+ years I manage to get WhatsApp proof that they have cheated me. All proofs are attached.

I have all the proofs with me:
-WhatsApp Chat with QNET IRS
-QNET (internal meetings I attended), How they plan and cheat innocent people and run away with their money
-How they plan to TRAP
-QNET IRS Photos/Mobile Details

He offered me a job at Lupin, Nagpur and asked me to deposit some money, I did as he demanded and then he informed me that I’ll have an interview with the HR from Lupin, it was a telephonic interview and nothing was given to me on Email.

Then the asked me to reached Nagpur on **/**/**** to have a direct interview with the Lupin management and told me that their agency will provide me flight tickets and hotel stay for the visit to Nagpur, meanwhile, he said he was travelling to Singapore for some business tour.

The date of the interview came but I did not receive an email or any travel ticket from Nishant and finally, my interview did not take place.

later when he came back to India he informed me that he asked his team member to send me that ticket via email but his team member forgot to do so, this is how unprofessionally they reacted. 



I found it all fraud and thought of going to their office and directly meet Nishant, so I travelled from Bhopal to Delhi and then to Noida Sector-***  in search of their office, but could not find a single building of that address in that locality.
the Address on their website is fake and even the company is fake.


but days passed and nothing was heard back from him, I tried calling him several time but he did not pick up my call or his mobile was switched off.

Finally, I tried connecting with him and asked him to refund the money, and he said he will refund the money in *-* business days but now his mobile no is again switched off and no response is available from him.

Secondly, they display these kinds of part-time jobs like data entry, excel numeric entry, SMS sending with plan payment details which are a total scam after full payment only I got to know. First if you pay any plan amount they will say it is only half amount you paid and tell us to look in terms and conditions page (this is the main scam they are using to cheat us they won't displaying anything in front page below data entry plan but after payment they say you should read terms and condition page which is displayed at end of page and not even visible). Third stage scam is that after you paid the full amount they send you a waste software link that has nothing to do with what they displayed in front page website and finally a word file that indicates that we should signup in freelancer. In website for getting projects (what the hell of a scam). After that when I asked about them they are saying that I should read terms and condition page carefully that it is my mistake like that and all. I attached all the screenshots details so please don't get scammed by these cheaters. My amount is gone that's why I am spreading this news to everyone so that you don't lose your hard-earned money.",OPEN

She told me a whole procedure to get a job apart from any kind of money transfer. Only she told me that when I received a job confirmation call only then I have to pay an amount of **** Rs only. I paid after receiving job confirmation. I have received another call which was of HDFC bank (according to that call) named ( on true called) Ajay Shrivastava.

As they are doing this I thought that as I am going to select in HDFC bank, I should discuss this thing because for me **,*** Rs is really a high amount to pay. So I went there and talked with Branch manager sir (Mr Shashi) and as I told him about this procedure of demanding money. They denied paying any amount at once. I called Ajay sir and he talked him Branch manager sir asked him for his employee Id but Ajay sir denied. It was a high shock for me but one of a member of Naukri.com give to do any kind of help.

I had already confirmed from the consultancy that my *.* yrs career gap will be accepted for c*h.  But they interviewed me for a permanent role because of my good academic performance.  I was selected and I sent my documents for approval. Then I got to hear that due to my career gap they won't take me for permanent. I was ok with this and was ready to go for c*h (through a consultancy named Empower It Systems Pvt Ltd.)
I got a call from Empower that I was selected in Newgen through Empower. I was done with a salary discussion as well and sent my documents for approval. But the next day I got a call from Newgen that the panel wanted a small discussion with me. I asked them if another interview was going to happen and the response was no. I went for their so-called discussion. But they interviewed me technically. I was not aware of this interview because I was told that a normal discussion was to be done. I have never seen a company doing salary discussion and document verification first and then taking the technical interview and that too after a successful interview. When I asked the consultancy about this fraud interview, they said that they were not aware of this interview. I think they should close their firm if they don't even know what is being done with the candidates they send. After *-* missed calls to Empower, I got a message that my profile was on hold because I have done my education from LPU. What a lame reason they gave because I have one known person who has already worked with Newgen and is from LPU.
Then I had a conversation with the HR of Newgen (Mr Devendra Kashyap) and got to know another brand new reason for my rejection through consultancy and it was my career gap. Till the time I went for the interview and was selected, my career gap was an objection for the permanent role only, but immediately after *-** days their policy is changing and this gap becomes an issue for consultancy as well.  Whenever I call to the Newgen HR they blame Empower and whenever I call to the consultancy they blame Newgen. But the one who suffers is me and not the consultancy or the company. 
Empower consultancy provided me with wrong information and tried to mislead me by giving the lame reason for the university. My resume was already with Newgen in which my career gap was clearly shown but then also they interviewed me for permanent and after the successful interview, they denied my selection because of the career gap. They should clearly examine the resume before calling any candidate for an interview. Betraying the candidate might be a simple task for the consultancy or the company but it hurts the feelings of the candidate. Will never ever suggest anyone join Newgen or to through Empower IT Systems Pvt Ltd for an interview because you never know when you will be called for an untold interview that too after your salary discussion and will be given lame reasons for your rejection.",OPEN

Once I was searching online job, I found the job of offline data entry on the www.quikr.com website and I applied.

But for that, you have to transfer of Rs ****/ - in our company's account as registration charges. After that, you will get work and you will get all this on the company's contract letter.
I also needed money at that time, so I transferred money to the company's account (attachment *). After that, they sent me * PDF files and the company's contract (attachment *). I repeatedly typed *** pages instead of *** pages day and night in ** days. They said that you wait for * to * days, we will reply after checking the work. After * days they reply that your accuracy level is less than **% (attachment *) and there are some spelling mistakes (attachment *) also and now you will not get any payment of this work - your contract has been cancelled and now you will not be given any work in the future and even the registration charges will not be refunded. It is a clear cheat.
My thoughts :
*. You see attachment * – company’ contract page number *. See the date of the stamp paper on that **/Nov/**** and there is agreement date between me and the company **/Feb/****. It seems to me clearly cheating. It means this company is robbing many people on the same stamp paper.
*. Mistakes (accuracy level of less than **%) - attachment *.
Yes, I also believe that there is hardly a member who does not make any mistake in typing *** pages. It can happen to me, but the mistakes that they are saying is a fraud. I typed * files what is the accuracy level that has been finalized by just * file? After checking all the files it should have seen the final.
*. Registration charges (****/-)
And if the company does not like my work then at least my registration charges will be refunded.

I used to pay him cash every month. And Now I’m financially down and I’m not in the position to pay the EMI. Unfortunately, family circumstances at this time require my full attention, and I have important issues to take care of, which leave me unable to pay the Upcoming EMI’s. I’m calling them everyday to give me a solution but instead of that they are saying that it is impossible. I told them I don’t want any refund but please cancel the EMI as I won’t be able to manage it and also because of financial problems I’m not even able to focus on my studies. I even told them that I will send the tablet and the books which are not even touched but they are just saying that it is impossible.

REG NO. ********** AND **********

Dear Team,

Request you to highlight a bitter experience mental stress and money loss happened due to the providing wrong updation to me on this process. I have approached by Ms. Bhaswathi one of  Y AXIS, HYDERABAD OFFICE on **** for migration process to Canada (ATLANTIC PIOLT PROGRAMME) on March ****. In her first call, she has explained the process in brief and she informed that from their end will be giving complete support till end to get the visa to be done. I have taken each and every clarification through mail  about IELTS score and each process one by one. She informed me that I need only *band to get eligible in this process. As per N number mail communication and conclusion had with her… I have given my documents for Evaluation process by paying an amount of Rs.****/-, in * days she informed me that I am eligible to this process. Before processing the same I have asked her clearly what are  the eligible criteria in age as well as in  IELTS Score, she informed I am eligible to do the process (age upto **years and ielts score of * band). With the continuous follow up with her I have paid partial payment of  *****/- other than that I have paid around *****/- (iqas eca process) and arrount ***** for IELTS test.  Total an amount of Rs.*Lakh I have spend from my pocket by trusting her words.

I have appeared by IELTS Score on September **** in general category I got *.* overall score(R *.*/W */ L */ S *.*) in your document it was clearly mentioned I required only *band. I have re confirmed it with Bhaswathi and she informed me the given score is sufficient to enroll the process.

In between the process your process consultant until I submit my document to IQAS was communicating with me, and received good support from him. I was surprised immediately several changes happened to my process consultants like virat, ramesh, pavan etc. Whenever the person joins I keep on explaining about process even they are in dilemma in may times. Any how, I again explained them all the process to get me a good support.  I was myself contact iqas to get my ECA Status until I get positive evaluation report which was received to me few days back. 

Job Marketing is totally waste : they just pushing my resume to different consultant, I have received many walk in interviews you understand clearly that which is impossible anyway. So, I don’t like to explain much… Even not offered any job from their end as discussed in the beginning of process. 

Now, the new process consultant Pavan he reversed the process and informed me I need to again attend IELTS Score to attain * and above in each subject as we have busy schedule even I am unable to attend any class or go and attempt for next level of exam. I felt this is utter cheating and I never suggest anyone to this company. 

When I was trying to retrieve my y axis login I felt ashamed that these people have dismissed my login even I could not able to take any history of my documents inside my login.  I have tried to contact them to get my refund several times and the person who is keeping in contact with me giving stories and even no updation received from higher management. I understood this agency doing cheating to people by giving them false commitments. 

Hence, request you assist me to get the refund amount what I have paid the the consultant by giving me false information to apply for the process.

They charged me Rs *****/- at the spot to give me ID to start the work and they told me that if i will complete target of **** resume in three month they refund my money ***** .They also make a contract in which all the terms and conditions are maintained.  I filled *** resumes in first month and portal showed ***/- for *** resume and in second month i made about **** resume but they didnt show my report for last ** days. when i asked for my refund they abused me and threatened me. When I called their customer care no one reply my calls and when I called on their office and talked to them that  they need to pay back my back my securities amount.

So dear Voxya Team. Please help me in this matter. I am not alone who suffer form this. There are so many other people also who are suffering the same situation.
After this all my matter I do some research on them. This all home based data entry line business are big frauds. They said they take data from other website like noukri.com and all and put in own portal and resell them, which also illegal. Because they used a person's personal information without their concern. 
So please look in this matter and stop this.

On April **, **** - Mr Akshay (+** ** **** ****/****/****), representing as Senior Recruitment Manager of jumbo-jobs.com (a division of Global Executive Solution) called me on my mobile for sharing * job opportunities in United Arab Emirates (UAE). He explained to me that jumbo-jobs.com would charge me USD **** for the service. Of this, USD *** is to be paid upfront as registration.
Based on his commitment, I made a bank transfer of Rs **,*** (equivalent to USD ***) from my HDFC bank account to Axis Bank Account named Global Executive Solutions (A/c No *************** - Ground Flr, Welcome Court Complex, Opp. Railway Degree College, Tarnaka Branch, Hyderabad ******).
As per the email sent to me by Mr Akshay, it was agreed that if I am not satisfied with the services I can opt for a refund within ** days. On payment of the fee of Rs **,*** - I have received an e-mail from cr@jumbo-jobs.com stating that I have been offered the following service:

Customized Recruitment Service: A dedicated SPOC will facilitate with opportunities, feedbacks and interview schedules. The SPOC will provide weekly once update call to discuss the progress and to share the feedback.                          

However, after * days of paying the fees on April **, I have not received any feedback or calls from any SPOC nor I have been informed about who is the SPOC. Also, my email to info@jumbo-jobs.com has also bounced. Hence, I e-mailed Mr Akshay and told him that there is no development from their team’s end. After that, I have received a couple of more opportunities by April **.

Again there has been no response for next full week and since the period of ** days was approaching, I have e-mailed Mr Akshay on * May that I am not satisfied with the response and service and would like a refund. On * May, Mr Akshay has e-mailed me stating reasons that the client to whom profile is sent is delaying and jumbo jobs cannot do anything about it. Also, he has refused a refund and stated that I should not be unsatisfied within ** days. I have made an international call to Mr Akshay and we have mutually agreed to increase the trial period to ** days.
I wanted to give an opportunity to jumbo-jobs and see if really there will be any breakthrough. However, the same situation has continued. Except for one more job application, they have not done anything and nor provided me with feedback on *-* jobs which they applied for earlier.

On one hand, they have charged Rs **,*** stating it as customized recruitment service and on another hand, nobody from jumbo jobs has given a status on what happened to *-* applied jobs nor on their own have jumbo jobs contacted me for new job opportunities.

Having decided to come out of this, I have again requested a refund on e-mail to Mr Akshay on ** May ****. However, instead of giving the refund, he has plainly blamed me and stated that it is management call whether to give a refund or not.

Now the situation is that they are not responding to my e-mail. I am very sure that jumbo-jobs is another fraud job portal like wisdom jobs. They are just taking registration fees under the pretext of customized recruitment services and cheating people in need like me.
